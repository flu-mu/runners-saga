# Implementation Status Summary - The Runner's Saga

## üéØ **Current Status: SCENE TRIGGER SYSTEM WORKING IN FOREGROUND**

**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0 - Core Functionality Complete  
**Build Status**: ‚úÖ iOS Build Successful  

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Working Perfectly**

### 1. **Scene Trigger System** üé¨
- **Sequential Scene Progression**: Scenes trigger at exact progress points (0%, 20%, 40%, 70%, 90%)
- **Audio Playback**: Each scene plays its corresponding audio file correctly
- **No More Simultaneous Playback**: Fixed the bug where all scenes played at once
- **Progress-Based Triggers**: Scenes trigger based on actual run progress (time/distance)

### 2. **Background Infrastructure** üîß
- **Timer Continuation**: Run timer continues running when app is backgrounded
- **GPS Tracking**: Location points continue to be collected in background
- **State Persistence**: Run data is saved and can be resumed
- **Service Coordination**: Background services work together seamlessly

### 3. **Core Running Features** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time distance, time, and pace updates
- **Target Management**: Users can set time or distance targets
- **Route Tracking**: GPS route is recorded and stored
- **Session Management**: Run sessions can be paused, resumed, and completed

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations**

### 1. **Scene Progression in Background**
- **Issue**: Story scenes only trigger when app is in foreground
- **Impact**: Users miss story progression if they background the app
- **Workaround**: Users must keep app open to experience full story

### 2. **Background Audio Management**
- **Issue**: Audio scenes don't automatically play in background
- **Impact**: Story continuity is interrupted when app is backgrounded
- **Workaround**: Manual return to foreground to continue story

---

## üîß **Technical Achievements**

### 1. **Fixed Critical Bug**
- **Problem**: All audio scenes were playing simultaneously on app start
- **Root Cause**: Infinite loop in scene trigger system due to redundant progress updates
- **Solution**: Restored original working scene trigger logic while preserving background functionality

### 2. **Background Service Architecture**
- **Progress Monitor Service**: Handles GPS tracking and progress calculation
- **Background Timer Manager**: Ensures timer continuity across app lifecycle
- **App Lifecycle Manager**: Coordinates all services during background/foreground transitions
- **Background Service Manager**: Manages native platform background services

### 3. **State Management**
- **Run Session Manager**: Coordinates all running services
- **Scene Trigger Service**: Manages story progression and audio playback
- **Audio Manager**: Handles audio operations with professional-grade features
- **GPS Persistence**: Route data is saved and restored across app restarts

## üì± **User Experience Status**

### ‚úÖ **Working User Journey**
1. User selects run target (time or distance)
2. Run starts with Scene 1 (Mission Briefing)
3. Real-time progress updates (distance, pace, time)
4. Scene 2 triggers at 20% progress
5. Scene 3 triggers at 40% progress
6. Scene 4 triggers at 70% progress
7. Scene 5 triggers at 90% progress
8. Run completes with full story experience

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Experience Gap**
- **Story Interruption**: If user backgrounds app, story stops progressing
- **Manual Intervention Required**: User must return to foreground to continue story
- **Incomplete Experience**: Users may miss key story moments

## üöÄ **Next Development Priorities**

### **Phase 2: Background Story Progression** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Background Scene Triggers**: Implement scene triggering when app is backgrounded
- [ ] **Background Audio Playback**: Ensure audio scenes can play in background
- [ ] **Notification System**: Alert user when scenes are ready to play
- [ ] **Background Story Continuity**: Maintain story progression without user interaction

### **Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
