## Quick Start Implementation Checklist (Daily)

- Goal & Success Criteria
  - Define today‚Äôs single goal in one sentence
  - Add explicit acceptance criteria (expected log/behavior)

- Scope
  - List exact files and functions to touch
  - Note affected services/models and platform surfaces (iOS/Android/Web)

- Safety Rails (do first)
  - Do not clean/rebuild unless a persistent build error blocks progress
  - Do not change dependencies or native configs unless essential and confirmed
  - The user runs Xcode builds locally; provide commands only if requested
  - iOS specifics:
    - Keep `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)` enabled in `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
    - Avoid adding/removing SceneDelegate or scene manifest
    - If dependencies change: run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

- Steps
  - Apply minimal, isolated edits; prefer guards and early returns
  - Follow naming/style; keep functions small and readable
  - If `pubspec.yaml` changed: run `flutter pub get` (then pod install for iOS)
  - Add targeted logs to verify behavior

- Validation
  - Location: call `_ensureLocationPermission()` before starting tracking
  - Maps: use `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` (no subdomains)
  - Ask user to run and share logs; do not start Xcode builds

- Rollback
  - Keep edits scoped so they can be reverted quickly if needed

- Closeout
  - Summarize edits (2‚Äì3 bullets) and next action
