# Episode 2: "The Radio Tower" - Complete Dialogue Script
**Runtime:** ~15 minutes | **Location:** Downtown Communications Hub

---

## Scene 1: Mission Briefing (3 minutes)
**Location:** Courier Corps Base - Radio Room
**Audio:** Radio static, electronic interference, frustrated technical sounds

**[SOUND: Multiple radios crackling with static, electronic beeping]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Frustrated, tired] Riley! Get in here! We've got a problem.

**RILEY:** [Alert, entering] What's the situation, Commander?

**MORRISON:** [Pointing at radio equipment] Communications are going to hell. Lost contact with three settlements in the last twelve hours. Springfield, Millfield, even Haven Ridge - complete radio silence.

**[SOUND: Radio static bursts, failed connection attempts]**

**MAYA:** [Concerned] That's not normal interference. Someone's jamming us, or worse - those settlements might be gone.

**TOMMY:** [Worried, young voice] My cousin lives in Springfield. They had over two hundred people last week.

**RILEY:** [Determined] What do we need to do?

**MORRISON:** [Pointing to map] Downtown communications hub. Old WXYZ tower, forty stories up. If we can get a signal booster online up there, we might be able to punch through whatever's blocking us.

**[SOUND: Equipment being packed, technical gear clinking]**

**MAYA:** [Cautious] Downtown's a nightmare, Riley. We're talking about maybe five thousand infected packed into twenty city blocks. And that's the ones we can see.

**RILEY:** How do we get to a forty-story building without being noticed by five thousand zombies?

**MORRISON:** [Grim] Very carefully. Maya, you're taking point on this one. Riley, you carry the radio equipment - it's delicate, but it's our only shot.

**[SOUND: Heavy equipment being lifted, technical beeping]**

**RILEY:** [Feeling the weight] This thing weighs as much as a car battery.

**MAYA:** [Reassuring] We'll take the maintenance tunnels as far as we can, then it's rooftop to rooftop. The infected don't look up much.

**[SOUND: Radio suddenly crackling to life]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio, very weak signal, lots of static] —ase... do you... copy? This is... Chen... Atlanta...

**MORRISON:** [Urgently into radio] Dr. Chen! Dr. Chen, we're reading you but barely! Repeat your message!

**DR. CHEN:** [Clearer but still weak] —ommunications... sabotage... someone doesn't want... settlements talking... be careful who you... trust...

**[SOUND: Signal cuts to complete static]**

**MAYA:** [Ominous] Sabotage. That means someone with technical knowledge is actively working against us.

**RILEY:** [Realizing] Someone who knows our radio frequencies, our equipment...

**TOMMY:** [Scared] Someone who might be listening right now.

**MORRISON:** [Decisive] All the more reason to get that tower online. Move out, and maintain radio silence until you reach the objective.

**[SOUND: Gear being secured, door opening to urban decay sounds]**

## Scene 2: The Underground Journey (4 minutes)
**Location:** Maintenance Tunnels beneath Downtown
**Audio:** Dripping water, echo, distant city sounds above, electrical humming

**[SOUND: Footsteps in tunnel, water dripping, electrical systems humming]**

**MAYA:** [Whispering] Stay close, watch your step. These tunnels flood during heavy rain, and some of the electrical systems are still live.

**RILEY:** [Quietly, adjusting equipment] This radio gear is throwing off my balance. How far to the tower?

**MAYA:** [Checking map with flashlight] Half mile through here, then we surface in the basement of the Meridian Building. From there, it's rooftop parkour to the communications hub.

**[SOUND: Sudden splash, echoing through tunnel]**

**RILEY:** [Startled] What was that?

**MAYA:** [Listening intently] Could be water... could be something else. Keep moving, but stay quiet.

**[SOUND: Footsteps continue, more cautious now, breathing slightly elevated]**

**RILEY:** Maya, can I ask you something?

**MAYA:** [Still alert] Shoot.

**RILEY:** Before all this, did you ever think about what you'd do if the world ended?

**MAYA:** [Slight laugh] Honestly? I thought I'd be useless. Spent my whole career in climate-controlled offices, managing security protocols for software companies. Never imagined I'd be teaching college kids how to outrun zombies.

**[SOUND: Metal clanging, distant and echoing]**

**MAYA:** [Alert] Hold up. That sound... it's rhythmic. Too rhythmic to be random.

**RILEY:** [Listening] Like someone's tapping on pipes?

**MAYA:** [Suspicious] Or signaling. Riley, we might not be alone down here.

**[SOUND: Footsteps ahead, cautious but deliberate]**

**RILEY:** [Whispering] There! Did you see that? Light ahead, moving.

**MAYA:** [Drawing closer] That's a flashlight. Human. Question is: friend or enemy?

**[SOUND: Whispered voices ahead, indistinct]**

**MYSTERIOUS VOICE:** [Male, cautious] —know they're down here... equipment's too valuable to ignore...

**SECOND VOICE:** [Female, harder] —orders are clear. No one reaches that tower...

**MAYA:** [Realizing, urgent whisper] Riley, we need to move. NOW. Different route.

**RILEY:** [Confused but following] Who were they?

**MAYA:** [While moving quickly] People who don't want our communications restored. Dr. Chen was right - this is sabotage.

**[SOUND: Faster movement through tunnels, breathing elevated]**

**RILEY:** [Keeping pace] The ladder up ahead - is that our exit?

**MAYA:** [Checking map] Emergency access to street level. Not ideal, but better than running into an ambush.

**[SOUND: Metal ladder being climbed, manhole cover being moved]**

---

## Scene 3: Rooftop Navigation (4 minutes)
**Location:** Downtown Rooftops
**Audio:** Wind, distant city sounds, zombie moans from street level below

**[SOUND: Manhole cover sliding, emergence onto busy street with distant zombie moans]**

**MAYA:** [Surveying situation] Okay, we're three blocks from the tower. Fire escape up to the roof of this building, then we jump building to building.

**RILEY:** [Looking around nervously] There are so many of them down there. Like a slow-moving river of death.

**[SOUND: Climbing fire escape, metal creaking, wind picking up]**

**MAYA:** [While climbing] The good news is they don't look up. The bad news is if we make noise, all of them will.

**[SOUND: Reaching rooftop, wind stronger now]**

**RILEY:** [Amazed] You can see everything from up here. The whole city... it's like a ghost town with a zombie problem.

**MAYA:** [Focused] See the communications tower? The one with the blinking red light?

**RILEY:** [Spotting it] Four buildings over. Some of those gaps look pretty wide.

**MAYA:** [Confident] You were a track star, right? Think of it as really high hurdles with very serious consequences for missing.

**[SOUND: Running start, leap to next building, landing with roll]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard but exhilarated] That was actually kind of fun!

**MAYA:** [Landing nearby] Don't get cocky. Next gap's wider.

**[SOUND: Sudden commotion from street below, increased zombie activity]**

**RILEY:** [Looking down] Something's got them stirred up down there.

**MAYA:** [Alert] The people from the tunnel. If they're causing distractions, it means they're coordinating something bigger.

**[SOUND: Building-to-building leap, longer distance]**

**RILEY:** [Mid-leap] Made it! But Maya, look at the tower building - there are people on the roof!

**MAYA:** [Landing, immediately alert] Armed people. And they're not setting up the equipment - they're dismantling something.

**[SOUND: Distant voices, equipment being destroyed]**

**HOSTILE VOICE:** [Shouting from tower] —repeater array is down! No one's getting long-range communication through here!

**MAYA:** [Grim] They're destroying the existing equipment. We're not just setting up a booster - we're walking into a trap.

**RILEY:** [Determined] People are depending on us. Those settlements could be dying while we stand here.

**MAYA:** [Proud] That's the spirit. You ready for this to get complicated?

**RILEY:** [Confident] Let's go save some lives.

**[SOUND: Final approach to tower building, equipment being secured]**

## Scene 4: The Tower Assault (5 minutes)
**Location:** Communications Tower - 40th Floor
**Audio:** High wind, structural sounds, conflict, radio interference clearing

**[SOUND: Stairwell climbing, heavy breathing, multiple floors being ascended]**

**MAYA:** [Breathing hard] Thirty-eighth floor... almost there... You okay with the equipment?

**RILEY:** [Winded but determined] It's heavy, but I've got it. Maya, what's our play when we reach the roof?

**MAYA:** [Strategic] Those people dismantling equipment - they can't be more than three or four. We set up fast, get a signal out, then get gone before they know what hit us.

**[SOUND: Door to roof opening, immediate wind and hostile voices]**

**HOSTILE LEADER:** [Surprised, aggressive] What the hell? How did you get up here?

**MAYA:** [Confident] Same way you did, genius. Riley, start setting up the booster!

**[SOUND: Equipment being rapidly assembled, tools clanking]**

**HOSTILE LEADER:** [Threatening] You're making a mistake! The old world is dead! These settlements need to accept that!

**RILEY:** [Working on equipment] Maya, I need two minutes to get this online!

**MAYA:** [Facing down hostiles] You hear that? Two minutes, and every settlement in a hundred-mile radius will be back in contact. Your little isolation plan is over.

**[SOUND: Footsteps approaching aggressively, equipment being defended]**

**HOSTILE MEMBER:** [Female voice from earlier] They're Courier Corps! If they restore communications, The Shepherd's plans—

**MAYA:** [Interrupting] The Shepherd? Who the hell is The Shepherd?

**HOSTILE LEADER:** [Zealous] The future of humanity! A clean world, without the weak weighing down the strong!

**[SOUND: Scuffle beginning, equipment working in background]**

**RILEY:** [While working] Sixty seconds, Maya! The signal's almost strong enough!

**[SOUND: More aggressive movement, something being thrown]**

**MAYA:** [Fighting] Riley! They're trying to push the equipment off the roof!

**RILEY:** [Protective of equipment] Not happening! This thing cost more than my college tuition!

**[SOUND: Radio suddenly crackling to life, clear signal]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Crystal clear now] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen, Atlanta Safe Zone. Please respond!

**RILEY:** [Excited, into radio] Dr. Chen! This is Riley! We're online!

**DR. CHEN:** [Relieved] Riley! Thank god! We're reading you perfectly. Are you at the downtown tower?

**MAYA:** [Still fighting] Tell her about the saboteurs!

**RILEY:** [Into radio] Dr. Chen, there are people actively destroying communication equipment! They mentioned someone called 'The Shepherd'!

**[SOUND: Sudden silence from hostiles]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Suddenly very serious] The Shepherd... Riley, you need to get out of there NOW. If his people are there, more are coming!

**[SOUND: Distant helicopter or vehicle sounds approaching]**

**HOSTILE LEADER:** [Backing away] You have no idea what you've just unleashed. The Shepherd will remember this.

**[SOUND: Hostiles retreating, equipment fully operational now]**

**MAYA:** [Catching breath] They're running. But Dr. Chen's right - if this Shepherd is organizing people, this was just the opening move.

**[SOUND: Radio crackling with multiple settlements coming online]**

**SETTLEMENT 1:** [Via radio] —ase, this is Springfield! We're alive! Trapped but alive!

**SETTLEMENT 2:** [Via radio] Haven Ridge checking in! We've been under siege for days!

**RILEY:** [Amazed] Maya, listen to this! They're all alive!

## Scene 5: Victory and New Mysteries (3 minutes)
**Location:** Return to Base
**Audio:** Base camp celebration, multiple radio communications, underlying tension

**[SOUND: Base camp door opening, people cheering]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Proud] Riley! Maya! You did it! We've got contact with seventeen settlements!

**TOMMY:** [Excited] Riley! You should hear the radio traffic! People are crying, they're so happy to talk to each other again!

**[SOUND: Multiple radio conversations overlapping, celebration sounds]**

**SETTLEMENT VOICE:** [Via radio] —thank you, Courier Corps! We thought we were the only ones left!

**RILEY:** [Happy but tired] It feels good to reconnect people. But Commander, we learned something troubling up there.

**MORRISON:** [Serious] Report.

**MAYA:** [Detailed] Organized saboteurs, well-equipped, working for someone called 'The Shepherd.' They're actively trying to keep settlements isolated.

**[SOUND: Radio crackling, Dr. Chen coming through clearly]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio] Commander Morrison, this is Dr. Chen. I need to speak with your team immediately.

**MORRISON:** [Into radio] Go ahead, Doctor.

**DR. CHEN:** [Urgent] The Shepherd isn't just a local problem. We've identified similar sabotage operations in twelve states. This is coordinated, nationwide. And Commander... they know about our research.

**RILEY:** [Curious] What research?

**DR. CHEN:** [Hesitant] What we're working on here in Atlanta... it could end the plague. But only if we can establish secure supply lines and communication networks. The Shepherd's people are trying to stop us.

**MAYA:** [Realizing] That's why they were so desperate to keep the tower down. They don't want settlements coordinating.

**TOMMY:** [Thoughtful] But why? Why wouldn't someone want the plague to end?

**DR. CHEN:** [Ominous] Because some people see the apocalypse as an opportunity, not a disaster. The Shepherd believes the plague is evolution - that humanity should embrace it, not fight it.

**RILEY:** [Determined] Then we'd better make sure he doesn't get his way.

**MORRISON:** [Decisive] Riley, Maya - excellent work today. But this was just the beginning. Dr. Chen, what do you need from us?

**DR. CHEN:** [Hopeful but serious] I need runners I can trust. Fast ones. What we're developing here... it could save everyone, but I need materials, and I need them transported safely across very dangerous territory.

**RILEY:** [Without hesitation] Whatever you need, Dr. Chen. That's what we do.

**[SOUND: Radio signing off, base camp settling]**

**MAYA:** [Reflective] You know, when I woke up this morning, I thought we were just fixing a radio problem.

**RILEY:** [Thoughtful] Now we're apparently fighting a shadow war against someone who wants the apocalypse to continue.

**TOMMY:** [Optimistic] But we got the settlements talking again! That's got to count for something!

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Final] It counts for everything, kid. Every connection we restore, every mile our runners cover, brings us closer to putting this world back together. And now we know there are people trying to stop us.

**RILEY:** [Resolved] Then we'll just have to run faster.

**[SOUND: Ambient base camp, radio chatter continuing]**

**NARRATOR:** [Riley's internal voice] Day two taught me something important: we're not just running from the infected anymore. There are people out there who want the world to stay broken, who see chaos as opportunity. But every settlement we reconnect, every life we save by running supplies... that's proof that humanity is worth saving. The Shepherd wants to divide us. We'll prove him wrong, one mile at a time.

**[SOUND: Fade to radio chatter and hope]**
