---

## Scene 1: Mission Briefing (3 minutes)
**Location:** Courier Corps Base - Abandoned Tech Facility
**Audio:** Low ambient tech sounds, drone humming overhead, holographic displays

**[SOUND: Electronic beeping, drone surveillance overhead, holographic interface sounds]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Gruff, checking displays] Alright, listen up, rookie. Riley, right?

**RILEY:** [Nervous but determined] Yes sir.

**MORRISON:** [Slight chuckle]. Maya, bring our newbie up to speed.

**[SOUND: Footsteps approaching, tech equipment powering up]**

**MAYA:** [Confident, seasoned] Riley, welcome to the Corps. I'm Ghost - call me Maya. Been doing this for eight months now. First rule: the Corporate hunter drones are predictable. They follow search patterns, they scan for heat signatures, and they report to central AI. It's the Corporate humans you gotta watch out for.

**RILEY:** How many... how many drones are patrolling out there?

**MAYA:** In the industrial sector? Maybe two dozen hunter drones scattered around. Corporate Central has thousands protecting the resource zones. But today's milk run. Simple supply cache retrieval.

**[SOUND: Holographic map activating, tactical display]**

**MORRISON:** Here's your route, rookie. [Pointing] Two miles northeast to the old distribution center. Supply cache is in the server room - power cells, medical nanobots, circuit boards. Should be a straight shot through residential ruins.

**TOMMY:** [Young voice, excited] Riley! Riley! I hacked the patrol schedules yesterday from my drone nest. Most of the hunters are on main transit routes, but there's a new patrol pattern near the playground sector.

**MAYA:** Thanks, kid. Riley, Tommy's our eyes and ears. Best tech scout we have.

**TOMMY:** I counted twelve hunter drones between here and the distribution center. Oh, and there's something weird - some of them were responding faster than usual, more aggressively.

**MORRISON:** [Concerned] Faster how?

**TOMMY:** Like... they've been upgraded? Never seen that response pattern before.

**[SOUND: Secure communication channel opening]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via encrypted comms, slightly distorted] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen, Haven Settlement. Secure channel active.

**MORRISON:** [Into comms] Copy, Dr. Chen. Morrison here.

**DR. CHEN:** Commander, we've been monitoring Corporate drone behavior. Reports of new hunter protocols, advanced tracking systems. Your people need to be extra careful out there.

**RILEY:** [Quietly] Great. My first day and the hunter drones got an upgrade.

**MAYA:** [Reassuring] Stick with me, and you'll be fine. Ready to save some lives?

**RILEY:** [Taking deep breath] Let's do this.

**[SOUND: Tech gear being secured, airlock door opening, ambient ruins sounds begin]**

## Scene 2: The Journey (4 minutes)
**Location:** Urban Ruins - Tech-Scattered Neighborhoods
**Audio:** Wind through broken buildings, distant drone humming, electronic interference

**[SOUND: Footsteps beginning at jogging pace, breathing steadily, distant drone sounds]**

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, breathing slightly heavy] Stay close, maintain this pace. See that collapsed overpass? Two hunter drones on patrol pattern, but they're facing away from us. We're invisible if we stay in the electromagnetic dead zone.

**RILEY:** [Breathing controlled] This feels surreal. Six months ago I was worried about midterms.

**MAYA:** What were you studying?

**RILEY:** Engineering. Wanted to build things that helped people, you know? Guess I still am, just... differently.

**[SOUND: Mechanical whirring, growing closer]**

**MAYA:** [Whispered] Hold up. You hear that?

**[SOUND: Drone rotors, scanning beam sweeping]**

**RILEY:** [Whispered] To our right. Behind the overturned delivery truck.

**MAYA:** Good eye. It's a standard hunter, running routine patrol. Let's give it space and keep moving.

**[SOUND: Footsteps resume, more cautious]**

**MAYA:** So what got you into running?

**RILEY:** My dad. He said running was the most honest sport - just you against yourself, no equipment, no teammates to blame. Never thought it would literally save my life from AI death machines.

**MAYA:** [Slight laugh] Mine too. Corporate security before the Resource Wars. Spent more time managing AI systems than outdoors. Amazing how the apocalypse can improve your cardio.

**[SOUND: Sudden mechanical screaming, much closer than expected]**

**RILEY:** [Startled] What was that?

**MAYA:** [Alert] That wasn't a hunter drone. Riley, we might have a problem.

**[SOUND: Fast-moving mechanical sounds, aggressive targeting systems]**

**RILEY:** [Panic creeping in] Maya, something's coming through the debris field!

**MAYA:** [Urgent] Run! NOW! Forget stealth - GO GO GO!

**[SOUND: Sprint begins, heavy breathing, fast footsteps on broken concrete]**

---

## Scene 3: First Contact (4 minutes)
**Location:** Distribution Center Approach
**Audio:** Sprint-pace breathing, mechanical pursuit, tech systems activating

**[SOUND: Sprint continues, breathing heavy, multiple mechanical sounds behind them]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard] What are those things?! They're keeping up!

**MAYA:** [Winded but focused] Interceptor drones! Tommy was right - they've been upgraded! Don't look back, just run!

**[SOUND: Energy weapons charging, targeting lasers]**

**RILEY:** [Terrified] IT'S TARGETING ME! I can see the laser sight!

**MAYA:** [Shouting] EMP barriers! Use the EMP barriers!

**[SOUND: Electronic crackling, emp field activating, drones shorting out temporarily]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing heavily] That... that stopped them!

**MAYA:** [Catching breath] Interceptor drones are fast but vulnerable to electromagnetic interference. The distribution center's just ahead - we need to get inside.

**[SOUND: More mechanical sounds, different patrol drones approaching]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard] There's more of them! A whole squadron!

**MAYA:** [Determined] The entrance - those security doors. We get inside, they'll have to follow us through chokepoints. Gives us an advantage.

**[SOUND: Security doors being hacked open, echo of facility interior]**

**RILEY:** [Amazed despite danger] Look at this place. It's like a tech graveyard.

**[SOUND: Footsteps echo in empty facility, distant mechanical humming from deeper inside]**

**MAYA:** [Cautious] Facility's not empty. Hear that? Maintenance bots deeper in, but they're standard units. The interceptors are our immediate problem.

**[SOUND: Security doors being tested, mechanical probing]**

**RILEY:** [Looking back] They're at the entrance, but they can't figure out how to override the door locks!

**MAYA:** [Relieved] See? Fast but programmed for external patrol. We've got maybe two minutes before they find another way in or call for backup. Server room's on the second level - let's move.

**[SOUND: Footsteps on facility floors, elevator system activating]**

**TOMMY:** [Via comms, excited] Riley! Maya! I can see you through the facility's security cameras! There are interceptors circling the building, but the main group's still trying to breach the front!

**MAYA:** [Into comms] Thanks for the eyes, Tommy. How many?

**TOMMY:** I count... six interceptors outside, maybe a half-dozen maintenance bots inside the facility, but they're all on the ground floor.

**RILEY:** [Breathing easier] We're almost there. I can see the server room access.

**[SOUND: Sudden alarm, security breach detected]**

**MAYA:** [Urgent] They're in! Move faster!

## Scene 4: The Crisis (5 minutes)
**Location:** Server Room & Facility Upper Level
**Audio:** Facility alarms, multiple drone types, security systems failing

**[SOUND: Mechanical whirring echoing through facility, alarm systems, footsteps pounding up access ways]**

**RILEY:** [At server room entrance] The quantum lock's still active! How do we get in?

**MAYA:** [Urgent] Check for a maintenance access - there! Behind the server banks!

**[SOUND: Electronic panel being accessed, supplies being grabbed]**

**RILEY:** [Focused] Power cells, nanobots, circuit boards... Maya, there's enough here for weeks!

**MAYA:** [Distant shouting from facility] Take what you can carry! We've got company!

**[SOUND: Multiple types of mechanical sounds - fast interceptors and slow maintenance bots]**

**RILEY:** [Confused] I thought you said the maintenance bots were slow?

**MAYA:** [Grim realization] The regular maintenance units are following the interceptors' signals! The upgraded AI is coordinating all the facility systems!

**[SOUND: Footsteps approaching their location, mechanical coordination]**

**TOMMY:** [Via comms, panicked] Guys! The whole facility's lighting up! Every bot inside is moving toward your location!

**RILEY:** [Packing supplies] How many exits are there?

**MAYA:** [Thinking fast] Service corridors behind the power distribution center, but we'd have to cross the main floor. Or... the cooling system ventilation Tommy mentioned.

**RILEY:** [Looking up] That's got to be twenty feet up!

**[SOUND: Door being breached, immediate mechanical threat sounds]**

**MAYA:** [Determined] Grab that server rack, we'll stack equipment to reach the ventilation system. Sometimes crazy is the only way out.

**[SOUND: Equipment being moved, climbing sounds]**

**RILEY:** [Climbing] This is insane! I can't believe I'm doing this!

**MAYA:** [Below, defensive] Just keep climbing! I'll jam their sensors!

**[SOUND: Door breaking, immediate danger sounds, EMP grenade detonating]**

**MAYA:** [Shouting] RILEY! GO! GET OUT OF HERE!

**RILEY:** [From above] I'm not leaving you!

**MAYA:** [Fighting sounds below] The supplies are what matter! People are counting on us!

**[SOUND: Ventilation system being accessed, Riley breaking through to exterior]**

**TOMMY:** [Via comms] Riley! You made it! Slide down the maintenance ladder - I can see a clear path home!

**[SOUND: Sliding, then running footsteps on facility exterior]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard, emotional] Maya! Maya, respond!

**MAYA:** [Via comms, breathless but alive] I'm okay! Found another way out! EMP grenade fried their coordination. Meet you back at base!

**[SOUND: Successful escape sounds, breathing slowing down]**

## Scene 5: Extraction/Debrief (3 minutes)
**Location:** Return to Base
**Audio:** Base tech sounds, inventory systems, relief and concern

**[SOUND: Base facility door opening, people gathering around, tech systems humming]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Concerned but proud] Riley! Report!

**RILEY:** [Exhausted but triumphant] Mission accomplished, sir. Power cells, nanobots, enough circuit boards for three days of tech repairs. But Commander... Tommy was right about the upgrades.

**[SOUND: Supplies being catalogued, inventory systems scanning]**

**MORRISON:** [Serious] Tell me everything.

**RILEY:** They're faster than we expected, but Maya was right - they're still just following programming. It's like they have speed but lost adaptive problem-solving.

**[SOUND: Airlock opening, Maya entering]**

**MAYA:** [Slightly winded] Miss me?

**RILEY:** [Relieved] Maya! How did you get out?

**MAYA:** [Casual] Service tunnel behind the power core. Led straight to the exterior maintenance bay. Though I did have to explain to a very confused cleaning bot why I was in its workspace.

**TOMMY:** [Excited] You should have seen it from the security feeds! Riley went through the ventilation like some kind of action hero!

**[SOUND: Secure communications activating]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via encrypted comms] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen. Did you recover the technology components?

**MORRISON:** [Into comms] Affirmative, Doctor. Full success, but we've confirmed the interceptor drone reports.

**DR. CHEN:** [Concerned] That's... troubling. We're seeing similar upgrade patterns here at Haven Settlement. Commander, I need to speak with your team about establishing a more regular tech supply line.

**RILEY:** [Curious] Supply line?

**MORRISON:** [Looking at Riley with new respect] Dr. Chen's working on something big down there. Something that could change everything. But she needs components, and we need someone fast enough to get them to her.

**MAYA:** [Grinning] Looks like the rookie's officially graduated.

**RILEY:** [Determined] Whatever she needs. People are depending on us.

**DR. CHEN:** [Via comms, hopeful] Riley, is it? Welcome to the fight. What we're working on here... it could level the playing field. Every component you retrieve brings us closer to ending Corporate control.

**[SOUND: Communications signing off, base facility winding down]**

**RILEY:** [Reflective] Six months ago, the biggest risk I took was choosing between pizza or Chinese food. Now I'm literally running from AI death machines for people's lives.

**MAYA:** [Wise] Funny how corporate warfare can show you who you really are.

**RILEY:** [Confident] Then I guess I'm a runner.

**MORRISON:** [Final] Damn right you are. Get some rest, rookie. Tomorrow we start planning something bigger.

**[SOUND: Footsteps walking away, ambient tech sounds fading]**

**NARRATOR:** [Riley's internal voice] Day one was supposed to be simple. A milk run, Maya called it. But nothing's simple anymore. Every step forward is a step toward hope, and every mile I run brings us closer to finding our way back to freedom. The Corporate AI is evolving, but so are we. And tomorrow? Tomorrow we run again.

**[SOUND: Fade to silence]**
