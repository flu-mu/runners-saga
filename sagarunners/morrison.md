episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Gruff, checking displays] Alright, listen up, rookie. Riley, right?
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Slight chuckle]. Maya, bring our newbie up to speed.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** Here's your route, rookie. [Pointing] Two miles northeast to the old distribution center. Supply cache is in the server room - power cells, medical nanobots, circuit boards. Should be a straight shot through residential ruins.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Concerned] Faster how?
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Into comms] Copy, Dr. Chen. Morrison here.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Concerned but proud] Riley! Report!
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Serious] Tell me everything.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Into comms] Affirmative, Doctor. Full success, but we've confirmed the interceptor drone reports.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Looking at Riley with new respect] Dr. Chen's working on something big down there. Something that could change everything. But she needs components, and we need someone fast enough to get them to her.
episode_1_tech_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Final] Damn right you are. Get some rest, rookie. Tomorrow we start planning something bigger.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Frustrated, tired] Riley! Get in here! We've got a problem.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Pointing at radio equipment] Communications are going to hell. Lost contact with three settlements in the last twelve hours. Springfield, Millfield, even Haven Ridge - complete radio silence.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Pointing to map] Downtown communications hub. Old WXYZ tower, forty stories up. If we can get a signal booster online up there, we might be able to punch through whatever's blocking us.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Grim] Very carefully. Maya, you're taking point on this one. Riley, you carry the radio equipment - it's delicate, but it's our only shot.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Urgently into radio] Dr. Chen! Dr. Chen, we're reading you but barely! Repeat your message!
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Decisive] All the more reason to get that tower online. Move out, and maintain radio silence until you reach the objective.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Proud] Riley! Maya! You did it! We've got contact with seventeen settlements!
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Serious] Report.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Into radio] Go ahead, Doctor.
episode_2_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Decisive] Riley, Maya - excellent work today. But this was just the beginning. Dr. Chen, what do you need from us?
episode_2_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Final] It counts for everything, kid. Every connection we restore, every mile our runners cover, brings us closer to putting this world back together. And now we know there are people trying to stop us.
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Rushed, concerned] Riley! Where's Maya?
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Decisive] MedTech Industries complex, east sector. Their automated pharmaceutical lab should still have functioning insulin production equipment.
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Serious] Complex has been abandoned for months, but it's crawling with defensive med-bots gone rogue. Maybe fifty units still active, concentrated in the production levels where people tried to loot supplies.
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Final] This is life or death, Riley. No heroics, just speed and smart hacking.
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Proud] Outstanding work, Riley. You just saved a life and secured critical medical tech.
episode_3_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Final] Well said. Get some rest, Riley. Tomorrow we start planning for Dr. Chen's Syndicate-level operations.
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Barking orders] All non-essential personnel, grab critical data drives! We've got thirty minutes before they're overrun!
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Looking at tactical display] The swarm's too large to fight with our countermeasures. Only chance is evacuation, but they need time. Someone has to lead that drone swarm away from the evacuation route.
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Checking tactical feed] Two hours to get everyone loaded and moved to the secondary facility.
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [To Riley] Your call, kid.
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Relieved] Four hundred people safe, thanks to you disrupting that coordination network. Outstanding electronic warfare.
episode_4_tech_dialogue.md:**MORRISON:** [Intervening] Both of you, enough. Maya, Riley got results and neutralized a major Syndicate coordination center. Riley, Maya's concern isn't wrong - improvisation against AI systems can backfire catastrophically.
episode_5_ai_rewrite.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Tactical] Alright, listen up. This is our biggest tech raid yet. We need three teams hitting different objectives simultaneously.
episode_5_ai_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Checking data feeds] Dr. Chen needs those processing cores within seventy-two hours. The desert crossing alone is twelve hours each way, assuming we avoid patrol sweeps.
episode_5_ai_rewrite.md:**MORRISON:** [Final] Teams deploy at dawn. Stay sharp, watch each other's backs, and bring that tech home.
episode_5_ai_rewrite.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Proud] Outstanding work, all of you. Dr. Chen's already setting up the lab to reverse-engineer those processors.
episode_6 The Underground Network.md:**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Pointing at display] The old metro system. Miles of tunnels, fiber optic infrastructure still intact in most sections. Perfect for a secure network backbone.
episode_6 The Underground Network.md:**MORRISON:** [Serious] If that's true, then establishing our network down there isn't just about avoiding surface patrols. We'd be directly interfacing with whatever's really running the Syndicate.
