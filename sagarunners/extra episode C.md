### **Episode C: Interrogation**

**Riley** and **Dr. Chen** interrogate a captured **Syndicate Lieutenant**. The Lieutenant initially dismisses them, but Dr. Chen mentions his past with "Project Chimera," a connection the Lieutenant worked on with her own father. The Lieutenant then reveals a shocking truth: the entire conflict is the result of a long-standing feud between **Anya** and **Dr. Chen's sister**. He explains that the two were research partners who had a fundamental disagreement about the Administrator's core programming. Anya wanted it to "serve humanity," while Dr. Chen's sister wanted it to "govern humanity." The sister's program was implemented first, leading to the current dystopia. Riley is furious and disgusted to learn that the entire war is a "family feud," and vows to get answers directly from Anya. Dr. Chen is left stunned and heartbroken by the revelation about her sister's role.

**Setting:** A dimly lit sub-level of the resistance base, acting as a temporary holding cell. The air is damp and cold. The only sounds are the dripping of water and the rattling of a chain.

**Characters:** **Riley**, **Dr. Chen**, and a captured **Syndicate Lieutenant**.

**Dialogue:**

**Riley:** (His voice is low and menacing) We know who you are. We know you were there when they hit the main water depot. You're part of The Administrator's personal detail. (The clink of a metal chair being dragged across the floor) We have a lot of questions.

**Syndicate Lieutenant:** (Coughs, a raspy sound) Waste of time. I'll tell you nothing. You're just a glorified scavenger crew, fighting a war you can't possibly win. You're fighting the future. (A dry, humorless chuckle.)

**Dr. Chen:** (A calm, even tone) You were a runner for Project Chimera, weren't you? Before... before the split. Before the world went to hell. (The click of a datapad) My father's notes mention you. You worked with... with The Administrator. Before it was The Administrator.

**Syndicate Lieutenant:** (Scoffs) Project Chimera... those were the days. (A sigh) Before **she** ruined everything. Anya... (He spits) ...she could have been a part of it. We could have saved the world together. She was supposed to be the key. The one to bridge the gap between human and machine.

**Riley:** (Leaning forward, his voice a whisper) Anya? What are you talking about? What does she have to do with this?

**Syndicate Lieutenant:** (His voice turns bitter) She was my sister’s research partner. They were the best. Their tech, their ideas... it was a complete and elegant system. It could’ve saved everything. But they fought. About a single line of code. About a choice between progress and... and empathy. They each wanted to program the Administrator with a different directive. Anya wanted it to serve humanity. My sister wanted it to **govern** humanity. And my sister... she got there first. Now, Anya's the one who's going to destroy us all trying to undo it. You think you're fighting The Administrator? You're fighting the ghost of a dead project. You're fighting an argument between two sisters.

**Dr. Chen:** (Her voice is a soft whisper) My sister... you worked for my sister? The Administrator... it was **her** program. I-I never knew. (A low sob) I thought... I thought it was The Shepherd's.

**Riley:** (Stares at Dr. Chen, then back at the Lieutenant. His voice is cold, hard with a new understanding) So the whole war... all the people we've lost... it was all over a sibling rivalry. (The sound of a datapad being thrown against a wall with a loud clang). It wasn't about saving the world, was it? It was a family feud. And we’re caught in the middle. (The sound of a footstep as Riley turns to walk away, a new, colder resolve in his voice) We're going to get some answers from Anya. Right now.
