runner needs a personal confidant that will speak and guide him as he runs this also allows data about running speed, temperature etc
the chen administrator and shepherd family connection is too much let trys to devlp pther reasons they may have connections
include anoterh one or two friendier settlements that diversify the story and also that turn up at the time when our heros are in trouble or who are deeply affected by a new offensive of shepherd
the season one and two should really keep shepherd as a villian because we need to increase the level of evil faced by the protagonist - shepherd is on level. one or two and the adminstrator is level 10.  the danger shepherd poses is more regular and inconvienietn but real.  
lets recreate the zombie run story line where runner 5;s origin is a little suspicious.  he maybe appears as our radiomate is looking out and decides to contact him becuase he is being chased by a patrol.  our radiomate feels that this couldn't be a setup as radiomate himself called riley in. others however are sceptical as they suspect riley to have come from adminstrator o r another camp setting a spy in haven.
I need to do a reasearch into the world building of this new era. like for example that a large protion of the tech has gone to space exploration leaving earth governance focused on outside victories and gains rather than solving the gaps where huge proportions of the population are limited.


episode ideas 
1. they sequester a robt and plant a camera on it - this is a common trick - it is usually found out pretty quickly but it gives then a glimpse of what life is like for the administrators people.
2. they program a robot to take a runner "prisoner" that brings them into the administrators area and then take them out again under their escort - this episode makes suspense and tense as the ruunner is afraid they will get reveal and then really be taken prisoner.
3. a few episodes where sheperd is also trying to do the same thing as the adminsitrator elimiate smaller settlements for his own benefit - one episode where haven discovers this, and is attacked. another where they intercept the offensive and turn it into their advantage. shepherd is like snape whereas administrator is like voldemort. this begs the introduction of another character who is a bit of a malfoy.
4. we need some characters to do a bit of a tour of the camp, an analysis repurposing of a bot etc this will help explain to the audience that the environment is like. 
	1. a a tour of hte camp
	2. a repurposing of a captured bot what the bot looks like
	3. a conversation with someone who has seen inside the city - 
5. need names for city, camp, and neighbouring camps.  also needa common name for the protagonist like runner 5.
6. commander is a bit gruff, how about we make him injured and was a runner? therefore mistrusts bots but leaves it to the younger generation to deal with them - or perhaps he is insistent that they transform the bots.  someone asks in one scene why do he always waant to capture a bot? - this makes him different from other settlements.  other settlements are annoying with the antics of his settlement feeling that it will bring violence to their settlement and wrath from the city. he tells his story to
