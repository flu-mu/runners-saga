# Episode 4: "The Decoy Protocol" - Complete Dialogue Script
**Runtime:** ~15 minutes | **Location:** Industrial Manufacturing District

---

## Scene 1: The Evacuation Crisis (2 minutes)
**Location:** Courier Corps Base - Emergency Briefing
**Audio:** Chaotic radio chatter, people packing frantically, urgent electronic interference

**[SOUND: Multiple encrypted radios crackling, people shouting orders, electronic equipment being packed rapidly]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Barking orders] All non-essential personnel, grab critical data drives! We've got thirty minutes before they're overrun!

**RILEY:** [Entering quickly] Commander, what's happening?

**MAYA:** [Grim, checking EMP charges] Riverside Settlement. Four hundred people, including sixty kids. Massive hunter drone swarm moving in from the east - they can't outrun coordinated AI pursuit.

**TOMMY:** [Panicked, at surveillance station] My aunt's there! She runs the tech education center!

**MORRISON:** [Looking at tactical display] The swarm's too large to fight with our countermeasures. Only chance is evacuation, but they need time. Someone has to lead that drone swarm away from the evacuation route.

**RILEY:** [Understanding immediately] Electronic decoy protocol.

**MAYA:** [Skeptical] Riley, this isn't a supply grab. You'd be intentionally broadcasting signals to attract maybe fifty hunter drones, then keeping them chasing you for miles.

**RILEY:** [Determined] How long do they need?

**MORRISON:** [Checking tactical feed] Two hours to get everyone loaded and moved to the secondary facility.

**MAYA:** [Concerned] Two hours of being hunted by coordinated AI swarms? That's not a mission, it's digital suicide.

**RILEY:** [Cold] Better than four hundred people being processed because I was too scared to run interference.

**[SOUND: Encrypted radio crackling urgently]**

**RIVERSIDE LEADER:** [Via radio, desperate] Courier Base! We can see them on our perimeter sensors! Please, if someone's coming, it has to be now!

**MORRISON:** [To Riley] Your call, kid.

**RILEY:** [Final] I'm going.

**[SOUND: Electronic equipment being grabbed, blast doors sealing]**

## Scene 2: Drawing the Swarm (2 minutes)
**Location:** Industrial District - Manufacturing Complex
**Audio:** Electronic humming, drone swarm coordination sounds, metal clanging

**[SOUND: Moderate running pace, growing electronic whine of approaching drones]**

**RILEY:** [Into earpiece] I can see them. Jesus, Maya, there's so many. They're moving in perfect formation.

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, tense] Remember, you need strong enough electronic signatures to get their attention, but varied enough to keep them engaged. Too predictable, they'll ignore you. Too chaotic, they'll spread out.

**[SOUND: Riley activating multiple electronic devices, signal jammers creating interference]**

**RILEY:** [Operating equipment] Activating signal beacons! Broadcasting on multiple frequencies!

**[SOUND: Massive electronic response - dozens of drones turning, coordination sounds changing]**

**TOMMY:** [Via earpiece, watching sensor feeds] It's working! The whole swarm's changing course toward you!

**RILEY:** [Starting to run, breathing harder] They're fast! And these aren't just standard patrol units!

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece] What do you see?

**RILEY:** [Running, analyzing] Mixed swarm - patrol drones, but also hunter-killers from the industrial raids. And something else... they're coordinating with ground units.

**[SOUND: Mechanical sounds from ground level, too organized]**

**RILEY:** [Realizing] Maya, this isn't autonomous behavior. Something's directing them with tactical precision.

**MAYA:** [Alert] What do you mean?

**RILEY:** [While running] They're not just pursuing me - they're herding me. Cutting off escape routes like they know the terrain.

**[SOUND: Human voice over loudspeaker in distance, drones responding]**

**RILEY:** [Shocked] Did you hear that? Human commander directing them!

**MAYA:** [Grim] Syndicate collaboration unit. They're using the drone swarm as a coordinated weapon.

## Scene 3: Human Controllers (2 minutes)
**Location:** Factory Catwalks and Control Rooms
**Audio:** Industrial machinery, human coordination chatter, drones below

**[SOUND: Climbing metal stairs, industrial echoes, drone swarm sounds below]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard] I'm on the factory control level. The drones can't reach me up here, but...

**HOSTILE VOICE 1:** [Over facility intercom] Target's in the control center! Lock down all exits!

**RILEY:** [To earpiece] Maya, there are Syndicate operatives here! They're running coordination from the facility!

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, angry] Human collaborators. They're not just directing the swarm - they're hunting you with tactical support.

**[SOUND: Electronic warfare - systems being hacked, alarms triggering]**

**RILEY:** [Working at control terminal] They're trying to lock me in!

**HOSTILE VOICE 2:** [Female, cold, via facility speakers] The drones will process Riverside, and we eliminate their best runner. Efficiency maximized.

**RILEY:** [While counter-hacking] They planned this. The swarm, the evacuation timing - it's all coordinated.

**TOMMY:** [Via earpiece, urgent] Riley, the evacuation's only half done! You need to keep drawing them away for another hour!

**RILEY:** [Determined, working at terminal] Then I guess I'm taking control of their coordination center.

**[SOUND: Electronic warfare intensifying, system overrides]**

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, frustrated] This is exactly what I was worried about! You're trapped in their facility!

**RILEY:** [Snapping] Well what would you have done, Maya? Let four hundred people get processed?

**MAYA:** [Defensive] I would have found a better technical solution!

**RILEY:** [Cold] We didn't have time for elegant hacking.

**[SOUND: Facility systems failing, emergency lighting]**

**HOSTILE VOICE 1:** [Closer, angry] Cut power to the control center! Force him into the drone kill zone!

---

## Scene 4: System Override (2 minutes)
**Location:** Factory Floor and Emergency Systems
**Audio:** Power failures, drone coordination chaos, electronic warfare

**[SOUND: Systems crashing, emergency power kicking in, drone swarm losing coordination]**

**RILEY:** [At emergency terminal] Power's down, but I've got backup access! Uploading corruption protocols to their drone network!

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, urgent] Sprint for the emergency exit! The drones are confused but still dangerous!

**[SOUND: All-out sprint, drones moving erratically, human pursuers]**

**RILEY:** [Running through chaos] The corruption's working! They're attacking each other!

**HOSTILE VOICE 2:** [Pursuing, panicked] The AI coordination is failing! We're losing control of the swarm!

**[SOUND: Riley sabotaging equipment while running, electronic explosions]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard] Overloading their server racks - complete system collapse!

**TOMMY:** [Via earpiece] Emergency exit's clear! But Riley, there's a problem!

**RILEY:** [Still running] What now?

**TOMMY:** [Worried] The humans controlling the drones - they're trying to manually redirect the confused swarm toward the evacuation route! They're using your signal as a homing beacon!

**RILEY:** [Realizing the trap] They want me to lead the drones to Riverside!

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, grim] That was always the backup plan. Whether they capture you or not, they win.

**RILEY:** [Determined] Not if I don't go where they expect.

**[SOUND: Electronic signatures changing, drone swarm reorienting]**

**HOSTILE VOICE 1:** [Confused, angry] Where's he going? That's not the route to Riverside!

**RILEY:** [Defiant] I'm going to lead your metal army somewhere they can't follow.

## Scene 5: Turning the Tables (2 minutes)
**Location:** Power Plant - High Electromagnetic Interference Zone
**Audio:** Electrical generation sounds, EM interference, tactical victory

**[SOUND: Running toward massive electrical installation, power generation humming]**

**RILEY:** [Into earpiece] Maya, remember the old fusion plant? The one with the EM interference warnings?

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, understanding] Riley, no. That's insane.

**RILEY:** [Determined] The drones can't operate in high electromagnetic fields, but a human with basic shielding...

**[SOUND: Power plant alarms, automated warnings about electromagnetic hazards]**

**AUTOMATED VOICE:** [Warning system] Danger. High electromagnetic field detected. All electronic devices will malfunction. Evacuate immediately.

**RILEY:** [To hostile pursuers via commandeered speaker] You want to keep hunting me? Come on!

**HOSTILE VOICE 2:** [Hesitating over radio] Fall back! The EM field will fry our equipment!

**RILEY:** [Putting on EM shielding gear] But not me. And your precious drones are about to become very expensive scrap metal.

**[SOUND: Drone swarm hitting EM field - systems failing, crashes]**

**RILEY:** [Triumphant] Your AI coordination is gone! Now they're just expensive junk falling from the sky!

**TOMMY:** [Via earpiece, excited] Riley! The evacuation's complete! Everyone's safe at the secondary site!

**RILEY:** [Relieved but cautious] Good. Now I just need to get out of this EM field before it cooks my gear too.

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, worried despite herself] The electromagnetic exposure won't hurt you short-term, but don't stay in there long.

**RILEY:** [Finding shielded exit route] There's a Faraday cage maintenance tunnel leading out. I can escape through the shielded maintenance system.

**[SOUND: Moving through shielded tunnel, electromagnetic interference fading]**

## Scene 6: Aftermath and Tension (2 minutes)
**Location:** Return to Base
**Audio:** Base camp relief, underlying tension, difficult conversations

**[SOUND: Base camp, people celebrating successful evacuation, electronic equipment humming]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Relieved] Four hundred people safe, thanks to you disrupting that coordination network. Outstanding electronic warfare.

**TOMMY:** [Excited] My aunt says the whole settlement's upgrading their tech education program because of what you pulled off!

**RILEY:** [Tired, not interested in praise] Just glad everyone made it out.

**MAYA:** [Approaching cautiously] Riley, we need to talk.

**RILEY:** [Cool] About what?

**MAYA:** [Defensive] About taking unnecessary risks. That EM field stunt could have fried your nervous system.

**RILEY:** [Sharp] But it didn't. And four hundred people are free.

**MAYA:** [Frustrated] That's not the point! You can't just improvise electronic warfare when people's lives are on the line!

**RILEY:** [Standing up to her] That's exactly when you improvise! When the protocols aren't working, you find a way to make them work.

**MORRISON:** [Intervening] Both of you, enough. Maya, Riley got results and neutralized a major Syndicate coordination center. Riley, Maya's concern isn't wrong - improvisation against AI systems can backfire catastrophically.

**[SOUND: Encrypted radio crackling]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio] Riley, this is Dr. Chen. I heard about the Riverside evacuation. Impressive systems warfare.

**RILEY:** [Into radio] Just doing my job, Dr. Chen.

**DR. CHEN:** [Serious] Actually, I'm calling about something else. Syndicate forces using human-AI coordination teams... it confirms our worst fears about what we're up against.

**MAYA:** [To radio] What do you mean?

**DR. CHEN:** [Ominous] The technology I need you to retrieve... it's not just for liberation protocols. It's for stopping people who can coordinate AI systems against human settlements. And Riley? The next mission will make today's electronic warfare look like basic training.

**[SOUND: Base camp falling quiet, tension building]**

**RILEY:** [Final] Whatever it takes, Dr. Chen. We're not letting the Syndicate process any more communities.

**[SOUND: Fade to uncertain quiet with subtle electronic humming]**
