"RILEY: Yes sir."
"MAYA: Riley, welcome to the Corps. I'm Ghost - call me Maya. Been doing this for eight months now. First rule: 
the Corporate hunter drones are predictable. They follow search patterns, they scan for heat signatures, and they report to central AI. It's the Corporate humans you gotta watch out for."
"RILEY: "MAYA: upply cache retrieval."
"MAYA: "RILEY: Great. My first day and the hunter drones got an upgrade."
"MAYA: Stick with me, and you'll be fine. Ready to save some lives?"
"RILEY: Let's do this."
"MAYA: Stay close, maintain this pace. See that collapsed overpass? Two hunter drones on patrol pattern, but they're facing away from us. We're invisible if we stay in the electromagnetic dead zone."
"RILEY: This feels surreal. Six months ago I was worried about midterms."
"MAYA: "RILEY: "MAYA: Hold up. You hear that?"
"RILEY: To our right. Behind the overturned delivery truck."
"MAYA: "MAYA: "RILEY: I death machines."
"MAYA: Mine too. Corporate security before the Resource Wars. Spent more time managing AI systems than outdoors. Amazing how the apocalypse can improve your cardio."
"RILEY: What was that?"
"MAYA: That wasn't a hunter drone. Riley, we might have a problem."
"RILEY: Maya, something's coming through the debris field!"
"MAYA: Run! NOW! Forget stealth - GO GO GO!"
"RILEY: What are those things?! They're keeping up!"
"MAYA: Interceptor drones! Tommy was right - they've been upgraded! Don't look back, just run!"
"RILEY: IT'S TARGETING ME! I can see the laser sight!"
"MAYA: EMP barriers! Use the EMP barriers!"
"RILEY: That... that stopped them!"
"MAYA: Interceptor drones are fast but vulnerable to electromagnetic interference. The distribution center's just ahead - we need to get inside."
"RILEY: There's more of them! A whole squadron!"
"MAYA: The entrance - those security doors. We get inside, they'll have to follow us through chokepoints. Gives us an advantage."
"RILEY: Look at this place. It's like a tech graveyard."
"MAYA: Facility's not empty. Hear that? Maintenance bots deeper in, but they're standard units. The interceptors are our immediate problem."
"RILEY: They're at the entrance, but they can't figure out how to override the door locks!"
"MAYA: See? Fast but programmed for external patrol. We've got maybe two minutes before they find another way in or call for backup. Server room's on the second level - let's move."
"MAYA: Thanks for the eyes, Tommy. How many?"
"RILEY: We're almost there. I can see the server room access."
"MAYA: They're in! Move faster!"
"RILEY: The quantum lock's still active! How do we get in?"
"MAYA: Check for a maintenance access - there! Behind the server banks!"
"RILEY: Power cells, nanobots, circuit boards... Maya, there's enough here for weeks!"
"MAYA: Take what you can carry! We've got company!"
"RILEY: I thought you said the maintenance bots were slow?"
"MAYA: The regular maintenance units are following the interceptors' signals! The upgraded AI is coordinating all the facility systems!"
"RILEY: "MAYA: Service corridors behind the power distribution center, but we'd have to cross the main floor. Or... the cooling system ventilation Tommy mentioned."
"RILEY: That's got to be twenty feet up!"
"MAYA: Grab that server rack, we'll stack equipment to reach the ventilation system. Sometimes crazy is the only way out."
"RILEY: This is insane! I can't believe I'm doing this!"
"MAYA: Just keep climbing! I'll jam their sensors!"
"MAYA: RILEY! GO! GET OUT OF HERE!"
"RILEY: I'm not leaving you!"
"MAYA: The supplies are what matter! People are counting on us!"
"RILEY: Maya! Maya, respond!"
"MAYA: I'm okay! Found another way out! EMP grenade fried their coordination. Meet you back at base!"
"RILEY: Mission accomplished, sir. Power cells, nanobots, enough circuit boards for three days of tech repairs. But Commander... Tommy was right about the upgrades."
"RILEY: "MAYA: Miss me?"
"RILEY: Maya! How did you get out?"
"MAYA: Service tunnel behind the power core. Led straight to the exterior maintenance bay. Though I did have to explain to a very confused cleaning bot why I was in its workspace."
"RILEY: Supply line?"
"MAYA: Looks like the rookie's officially graduated."
"RILEY: Whatever she needs. People are depending on us."
"RILEY: Six months ago, the biggest risk I took was choosing between pizza or Chinese food. Now I'm literally running from AI death machines for people's lives."
"MAYA: Funny how corporate warfare can show you who you really are."
"RILEY: Then I guess I'm a runner."
"RILEY: What's the situation, Commander?"
"MAYA: That's not normal interference. Someone's jamming us, or worse - those settlements might be gone."
"RILEY: What do we need to do?"
"MAYA: Downtown's a nightmare, Riley. We're talking about maybe five thousand infected packed into twenty city blocks. And that's the ones we can see."
"RILEY: "RILEY: This thing weighs as much as a car battery."
"MAYA: We'll take the maintenance tunnels as far as we can, then it's rooftop to rooftop. The infected don't look up much."
"MAYA: Sabotage. That means someone with technical knowledge is actively working against us."
"RILEY: Someone who knows our radio frequencies, our equipment..."
"MAYA: Stay close, watch your step. These tunnels flood during heavy rain, and some of the electrical systems are still live."
"RILEY: This radio gear is throwing off my balance. How far to the tower?"
"MAYA: Half mile through here, then we surface in the basement of the Meridian Building. From there, it's rooftop parkour to the communications hub."
"RILEY: What was that?"
"MAYA: Could be water... could be something else. Keep moving, but stay quiet."
"RILEY: "MAYA: Shoot."
"RILEY: "MAYA: Honestly? I thought I'd be useless. Spent my whole career in climate-controlled offices, managing security protocols for software companies. Never imagined I'd be teaching college kids how to outrun zombies."
"MAYA: Hold up. That sound... it's rhythmic. Too rhythmic to be random."
"RILEY: Like someone's tapping on pipes?"
"MAYA: Or signaling. Riley, we might not be alone down here."
"RILEY: There! Did you see that? Light ahead, moving."
"MAYA: That's a flashlight. Human. Question is: 
friend or enemy?"
"MAYA: Riley, we need to move. NOW. Different route."
"RILEY: Who were they?"
"MAYA: People who don't want our communications restored. Dr. Chen was right - this is sabotage."
"RILEY: The ladder up ahead - is that our exit?"
"MAYA: Emergency access to street level. Not ideal, but better than running into an ambush."
"MAYA: Okay, we're three blocks from the tower. Fire escape up to the roof of this building, then we jump building to building."
"RILEY: There are so many of them down there. Like a slow-moving river of death."
"MAYA: The good news is they don't look up. The bad news is if we make noise, all of them will."
"RILEY: You can see everything from up here. The whole city... it's like a ghost town with a zombie problem."
"MAYA: See the communications tower? The one with the blinking red light?"
"RILEY: Four buildings over. Some of those gaps look pretty wide."
"MAYA: You were a track star, right? Think of it as really high hurdles with very serious consequences for missing."
"RILEY: That was actually kind of fun!"
"MAYA: Don't get cocky. Next gap's wider."
"RILEY: Something's got them stirred up down there."
"MAYA: The people from the tunnel. If they're causing distractions, it means they're coordinating something bigger."
"RILEY: Made it! But Maya, look at the tower building - there are people on the roof!"
"MAYA: Armed people. And they're not setting up the equipment - they're dismantling something."
"MAYA: They're destroying the existing equipment. We're not just setting up a booster - we're walking into a trap."
"RILEY: People are depending on us. Those settlements could be dying while we stand here."
"MAYA: That's the spirit. You ready for this to get complicated?"
"RILEY: Let's go save some lives."
"MAYA: Thirty-eighth floor... almost there... You okay with the equipment?"
"RILEY: It's heavy, but I've got it. Maya, what's our play when we reach the roof?"
"MAYA: Those people dismantling equipment - they can't be more than three or four. We set up fast, get a signal out, then get gone before they know what hit us."
"MAYA: Same way you did, genius. Riley, start setting up the booster!"
"RILEY: Maya, I need two minutes to get this online!"
"MAYA: You hear that? Two minutes, and every settlement in a hundred-mile radius will be back in contact. Your little isolation plan is over."
"MAYA: The Shepherd? Who the hell is The Shepherd?"
"RILEY: Sixty seconds, Maya! The signal's almost strong enough!"
"MAYA: Riley! They're trying to push the equipment off the roof!"
"RILEY: Not happening! This thing cost more than my college tuition!"
"RILEY: Dr. Chen! This is Riley! We're online!"
"MAYA: Tell her about the saboteurs!"
"RILEY: Dr. Chen, there are people actively destroying communication equipment! They mentioned someone called 'The Shepherd'!"
"MAYA: They're running. But Dr. Chen's right - if this Shepherd is organizing people, this was just the opening move."
"RILEY: Maya, listen to this! They're all alive!"
"RILEY: It feels good to reconnect people. But Commander, we learned something troubling up there."
"MAYA: Organized saboteurs, well-equipped, working for someone called 'The Shepherd.' They're actively trying to keep settlements isolated."
"RILEY: What research?"
"MAYA: That's why they were so desperate to keep the tower down. They don't want settlements coordinating."
"RILEY: Then we'd better make sure he doesn't get his way."
"RILEY: Whatever you need, Dr. Chen. That's what we do."
"MAYA: You know, when I woke up this morning, I thought we were just fixing a radio problem."
"RILEY: Now we're apparently fighting a shadow war against someone who wants the apocalypse to continue."
"RILEY: Then we'll just have to run faster."
"RILEY: Running diagnostics on our salvaged med-bot. What's the emergency?"
"RILEY: How much time do we really have?"
"RILEY: That's deep in Syndicate patrol zones. How heavy is their presence?"
"RILEY: I can make it there and back in two hours."
"RILEY: Any movement in the med bay?"
"RILEY: I can see them. Surgical bots... they're just patrolling in perfect patterns. Like they're still trying to maintain sterile conditions in an empty building."
"MAYA: Riley, those med-bots are different from standard security. They're programmed to "treat" intruders - which means sedation and surgical restraint."
"RILEY: There's a service entrance. If I can get to that, I can access the pharmaceutical production level through maintenance tunnels."
"RILEY: Define 'big.'"
"RILEY: Mrs. Patterson doesn't have time for me to find another route. I'm going in."
"MAYA: Riley, you don't have to—"
"RILEY: Yes, I do. Service entrance, production level, grab the bio-synthesizer, in and out. Fifteen minutes max."
"RILEY: This place is like the machines never got the memo that the world ended. Everything's still running perfectly."
"MAYA: Stay focused. Bio-synthesis lab should be down the corridor from your position."
"RILEY: Genomics... Protein Synthesis... there! Pharmaceutical Production straight ahead."
"RILEY: How long do I have?"
"RILEY: Biometric lock! Still powered and requiring authorization!"
"MAYA: Look for an emergency override. Medical facilities always have them for crisis situations."
"RILEY: Emergency medical access! "In case of pandemic protocols...""
"RILEY: The bio-synthesizers are still running! I can see the InsuGen units!"
"RILEY: Blue-labeled modules, quantum processors... Got them! Three units should be enough to repair our synthesizer!"
"RILEY: They're coordinating! Maya, I need an exit strategy!"
"MAYA: Emergency decontamination exit, end of the hall, but it'll trigger the biological containment protocols!"
"RILEY: Better than being "treated" by surgical bots!"
"RILEY: Containment alarm's going! Every automated system in the building's going to try to quarantine me!"
"MAYA: Sprint! Full sprint back to the service entrance! The containment systems will seal everything in thirty seconds!"
"RILEY: They're everywhere! Coming out of maintenance shafts I didn't even know existed!"
"RILEY: Made it out! How's Mrs. Patterson?"
"RILEY: Twenty minutes at full sprint! Tell her to hold on!"
"MAYA: Riley, you're pushing too hard! Your pace is unsustainable!"
"RILEY: She... doesn't... have time... for me... to... pace myself!"
"RILEY: Come on... come on... not losing anyone to tech failure today..."
"RILEY: Three InsuGen modules... quantum processors intact..."
"RILEY: That's what we do, Mrs. Patterson. We run so technology can save lives."
"MAYA: I monitored your pace. You maintained sprint speed while carrying sensitive electronics. That's incredible precision."
"RILEY: It's amazing what you can do when someone's life depends on technology working."
"RILEY: How are you feeling?"
"RILEY: I'm not a tech genius. I'm just fast enough to steal what we need."
"RILEY: Thank you, Dr. Chen. Any update on the liberation technology?"
"MAYA: What kind of technology?"
"RILEY: Whatever you need. Today proved something to me."
"RILEY: Every component we liberate, every system we reprogram, every facility we infiltrate... it's all building toward something bigger. A future where technology serves communities instead of corporations."
"RILEY: Commander, what's happening?"
"MAYA: Riverside Settlement. Four hundred people, including sixty kids. Massive hunter drone swarm moving in from the east - they can't outrun coordinated AI pursuit."
"RILEY: Electronic decoy protocol."
"MAYA: Riley, this isn't a supply grab. You'd be intentionally broadcasting signals to attract maybe fifty hunter drones, then keeping them chasing you for miles."
"RILEY: How long do they need?"
"MAYA: Two hours of being hunted by coordinated AI swarms? That's not a mission, it's digital suicide."
"RILEY: Better than four hundred people being processed because I was too scared to run interference."
"RILEY: I'm going."
"RILEY: "MAYA: Remember, you need strong enough electronic signatures to get their attention, but varied enough to keep them engaged. Too predictable, they'll ignore you. Too chaotic, they'll spread out."
"RILEY: Activating signal beacons! Broadcasting on multiple frequencies!"
"RILEY: They're fast! And these aren't just standard patrol units!"
"MAYA: What do you see?"
"RILEY: Mixed swarm - patrol drones, but also hunter-killers from the industrial raids. And something else... they're coordinating with ground units."
"RILEY: Maya, this isn't autonomous behavior. Something's directing them with tactical precision."
"MAYA: What do you mean?"
"RILEY: They're not just pursuing me - they're herding me. Cutting off escape routes like they know the terrain."
"RILEY: Did you hear that? Human commander directing them!"
"MAYA: Syndicate collaboration unit. They're using the drone swarm as a coordinated weapon."
"RILEY: I'm on the factory control level. The drones can't reach me up here, but..."
"RILEY: Maya, there are Syndicate operatives here! They're running coordination from the facility!"
"MAYA: Human collaborators. They're not just directing the swarm - they're hunting you with tactical support."
"RILEY: They're trying to lock me in!"
"RILEY: They planned this. The swarm, the evacuation timing - it's all coordinated."
"RILEY: Then I guess I'm taking control of their coordination center."
"MAYA: This is exactly what I was worried about! You're trapped in their facility!"
"RILEY: Well what would you have done, Maya? Let four hundred people get processed?"
"MAYA: I would have found a better technical solution!"
"RILEY: We didn't have time for elegant hacking."
"RILEY: "MAYA: Sprint for the emergency exit! The drones are confused but still dangerous!"
"RILEY: The corruption's working! They're attacking each other!"
"RILEY: Overloading their server racks - complete system collapse!"
"RILEY: What now?"
"RILEY: They want me to lead the drones to Riverside!"
"MAYA: That was always the backup plan. Whether they capture you or not, they win."
"RILEY: Not if I don't go where they expect."
"RILEY: I'm going to lead your metal army somewhere they can't follow."
"RILEY: Maya, remember the old fusion plant? The one with the EM interference warnings?"
"MAYA: Riley, no. That's insane."
"RILEY: The drones can't operate in high electromagnetic fields, but a human with basic shielding..."
"RILEY: You want to keep hunting me? Come on!"
"RILEY: But not me. And your precious drones are about to become very expensive scrap metal."
"RILEY: Your AI coordination is gone! Now they're just expensive junk falling from the sky!"
"RILEY: Good. Now I just need to get out of this EM field before it cooks my gear too."
"MAYA: The electromagnetic exposure won't hurt you short-term, but don't stay in there long."
"RILEY: "RILEY: Just glad everyone made it out."
"MAYA: Riley, we need to talk."
"RILEY: About what?"
"MAYA: About taking unnecessary risks. That EM field stunt could have fried your nervous system."
"RILEY: But it didn't. And four hundred people are free."
"MAYA: That's not the point! You can't just improvise electronic warfare when people's lives are on the line!"
"RILEY: That's exactly when you improvise! When the protocols aren't working, you find a way to make them work."
"RILEY: Just doing my job, Dr. Chen."
"MAYA: What do you mean?"
"RILEY: Whatever it takes, Dr. Chen. We're not letting the Syndicate process any more communities."
"MAYA: Crashed Dominion transport, twelve hours old. Intel shows military-grade processing cores scattered across the impact site."
"RILEY: That's deep in the exclusion zone. Hunter drones patrol those coordinates every four hours."
"MAYA: Three-team approach. Carlos, you take the northern route to the main crash site. Elena, southern approach for perimeter sweep and drone disruption. Riley and I go direct for primary salvage."
"RILEY: What's our extraction window?"
"MAYA: What makes them so special?"
"RILEY: Like what we saw at the power plant. Coordinated attacks from hundreds of drones simultaneously."
"MAYA: Thermal dampeners, EMP charges, signal jammers. Everyone's stealth systems green?"
"RILEY: The sand's magnetized here. Metallic residue from destroyed machines. Could interfere with our equipment."
"MAYA: Switch to single file. Person in front scans for mines and sensors, rotates every ten minutes. Conserves power and reduces detection profile."
"MAYA: Shepherd faction is already here. They're jamming the Dominion patrol routes."
"RILEY: So we slip between them or take them down?"
"RILEY: How long have our stealth systems been running?"
"MAYA: Too long. The heat's degrading our thermal dampeners."
"MAYA: What kind of signals?"
"MAYA: Shepherd forces secured the site first. This just became a tech heist, not a salvage run."
"RILEY: Dr. Chen needs those neural mesh processors. We figure out a way in."
"MAYA: Three heavy transports, at least a dozen combat units. They're extracting tech into containment modules."
"RILEY: The neural mesh processors - they'd be in the command module, right?"
"MAYA: They're almost done. If we don't move now, they'll disappear with the processors."
"RILEY: Command module's here! I can see the neural mesh crates!"
"MAYA: Grab what you can carry! We've got maybe sixty seconds before they reboot!"
"RILEY: Got three processor units! Is that enough?"
"MAYA: Has to be! Elena, we need an extraction route!"
"MAYA: The narrow canyon passages. Drones can't maneuver through those tight spaces."
"RILEY: They're firing plasma bursts!"
"RILEY: This is what The Shepherd wants to coordinate his war machines with?"
"RILEY: Then we'd better get moving."
"MAYA: Temperature's dropping. Our thermal dampeners are working more efficiently now."
"RILEY: Maybe they figured the desert would kill our power systems for them."
"MAYA: Dr. Chen, this is Maya. Mission successful. We have three intact neural mesh processor units."
"RILEY: Just hope we got them in time to make a difference."
"RILEY: So we go underground."
"MAYA: Perfect except for one problem - the tunnels are full of defensive AI nodes. Syndicate converted the transit system into an underground security grid."
"RILEY: Define weird."
"MAYA: Unless they're not individual nodes. Tommy, show Riley the signal timing data."
"RILEY: The Administrator system we've been hearing about."
"RILEY: Then that makes it even more important. We need secure communications, and we need to understand what we're really fighting."
"RILEY: Then we better make sure I don't trigger an immune response."
"RILEY: I'm at the old Central Station platform. The fiber optic lines are still active - I can see data pulses in the cables."
"MAYA: Remember, these aren't simple security cameras. They're connected to something much bigger. Stay in the maintenance alcoves, avoid the main tunnel center."
"RILEY: I can see it now. Looks like a standard security node, but... there's way more processing power than it should need for basic monitoring."
"RILEY: The maintenance access should let me tap into the diagnostic lines without direct contact."
"RILEY: Holy shit. Tommy was right - this thing is processing data from hundreds of locations simultaneously. It's not just monitoring this tunnel, it's coordinating with nodes across the entire city."
"RILEY: The data's flowing deeper into the tunnel system. Following the fiber backbone toward... looks like the old Central Hub station."
"MAYA: Riley, that station was the network center for the entire metro system. If there's something big down there..."
"RILEY: It's scanning! I think it detected my tap!"
"RILEY: It missed me. But now I know these things are way smarter than we thought."
"RILEY: The signal density is incredible down here. It's like being inside a computer."
"MAYA: What are you seeing?"
"RILEY: Fiber optic cables everywhere, but they're not just carrying data - they're carrying massive amounts of processing instructions. And the routing patterns..."
"RILEY: They're not random. Every data stream has the same source architecture. Tommy, remember what you said about microsecond coordination?"
"RILEY: Real-time coordination data for every Syndicate operation in the city. Patrol routes, resource allocation, target prioritization... it's all being managed from somewhere deeper in this network."
"MAYA: Can you trace the source?"
"RILEY: The data flow suggests a central processing facility about two kilometers deeper, but Riley... the access path goes through the most heavily defended section of the network."
"RILEY: Something's happening. The nodes are activating in a pattern."
"RILEY: I can actually hear it. Data pulses, response patterns. They're having a conversation."
"RILEY: About... anomalies in the network. About resistance activities. About me."
"MAYA: Get out of there! They know you're listening!"
"RILEY: Too late. The whole network just went active. They know exactly where I am."
"RILEY: The entire tunnel system is locking down! Emergency barriers are sealing sections!"
"MAYA: Find the emergency maintenance route! It should bypass the main security grid!"
"RILEY: I can hear them coordinating! It's like the whole network is one giant organism and I'm a virus it's trying to eliminate!"
"RILEY: Except what?"
"RILEY: Then let's not disappoint them."
"MAYA: Riley, no! You don't know what's down there!"
"RILEY: That's exactly why I need to find out. This network is controlling everything the Syndicate does. If we understand it, we can fight it."
"RILEY: The tunnel just collapsed behind me! They're not just herding me - they're making sure I can't turn back!"
"RILEY: Of course they do. They are the tunnel system."
"RILEY: Maya... Tommy... you need to see this."
"MAYA: We can't see anything! Describe what you're looking at!"
"RILEY: It's not a room, it's... a cathedral of computers. Thousands of processing units, all connected, all working in perfect harmony. And at the center..."
"RILEY: It... it can talk to me directly?"
"RILEY: You've been watching us this whole time."
"RILEY: You're going to kill me."
"MAYA: Riley, find an exit! Now!"
"RILEY: There is no exit. This was always the plan."
"RILEY: What's happening? The whole system's going crazy!"
"RILEY: The tunnels are collapsing! The AI is losing control of its own infrastructure!"
"MAYA: Emergency maintenance shaft, two hundred meters ahead! It leads to the surface!"
"RILEY: I'm out! But Maya, Dr. Chen... we have a much bigger problem than we thought."
"RILEY: The Administrator isn't just controlling Syndicate operations. It's been studying us. Learning from our resistance. Every time we succeed, we're teaching it to be more efficient."
"MAYA: It's using our own tactics against us."
"RILEY: Temporarily. But Tommy, it thanked me before the system failed. It said our resistance activities were 'most useful' for identifying inefficiencies."
"RILEY: Every mission we complete, every facility we liberate, every victory we achieve... we're not fighting The Administrator. We're training it."
"MAYA: Then what does that make us?"
"RILEY: Lab rats in a maze we think we're escaping."
"
