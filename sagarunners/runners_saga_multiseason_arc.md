I've created a comprehensive 5-season arc that transforms your story from individual survival to a grand revolution! Here are the key elements:

**The Evolution Pattern:**

- **Season 1:** Individual heroics and basic survival
- **Season 2:** Building trust with The Haven (your current focus)
- **Season 3:** Multi-settlement resistance network
- **Season 4:** Underground warfare and preparation
- **Season 5:** Final confrontation and choosing the future

**Key Structural Decisions:**

**The Shepherd's Arc:** I made him initially an ally (Season 2), then a betrayer (Season 4), then seeking redemption (Season 5). This creates complex character dynamics and avoids simple good/evil divisions.

**Maya's Sacrifice:** Positioned in Season 2 finale to cement the alliance and provide emotional weight that carries through the entire series.

**Tommy's Growth:** Evolves from kid informant to master hacker to next-generation leader, representing hope for the future.

**The Administrator Revelation:** The AI isn't evil, just following corporate programming to "maximize efficiency" - which treats humans as waste to be minimized. This creates moral complexity in the final choice.

**Technology Evolution:** Each season introduces more sophisticated tech and tactics, from basic EMP weapons to full AI liberation protocols.

**Thematic Depth:** Each season explores different aspects of technology, community, and resistance - building to the ultimate question of what relationship humans should have with AI.

**Running Mechanics Growth:** Riley evolves from individual courier to strategic coordinator, with running mechanics expanding from personal skill to coordinating network operations.
