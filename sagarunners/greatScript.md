Scene 1

Able Township’s just on the horizon. See it now? Not much more than a few fences to keep the zoms out. I don’t know how they live like that. Guess they won’t be living like that much longer. Able Township. Jolly Alpha 59er from Mullen’s Military Base. We’re five miles out, approaching from the east, bringing med supplies, shelters, and loan of one of our people. Able Township, Jolly 59er requesting permission to land.

Got that… uh… I mean, roger that. You’re clear to… yeah, you can… you can come on in. Roger, Able. Heading down now. Level with me. You and me both know we haven’t got half the usual supplies. We’ve lied to the township. Yeah, I know you don’t know anything. Someone at Able is going to come up to you and say, “I’m here to brief you on Project Green Shoot.” And then you’ll find out what your mission really is. I just… what the hell? Someone’s shooting. That’s not from the township. Who the hell has a rocket launcher? We’re hit! I’ve lost the tail rotor. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Jolly 59er going down three miles east of Able Township. Two souls on board. This is Able Township calling. Supply copter, can you hear us? You’re coming down fast. Can any of you hear us? Open your shoots. Don’t jump.

Hey. Hey, I… I… this is Able Township calling, over. If there’s anyone alive, if you’ve got your parachute open, this is Samiau from Able Township. Oh, I’m just a… I’m just a radio operator, man. I’m not supposed to handle this stuff. You’ve come down in a horde of zombies. They’ve heard the noise. They’re coming. There are 30… no, 40. Ah, crap. Your only safe path is towards the tower. If there’s anyone alive there, just run. Run!



scene 2

Wow, there’s… there’s someone alive down there. Running. Hey, can you hear me? No answer. Still, just… look at ‘em go! Heading for the tower, just like I said. Okay, running person, if you can hear me… well, you’re going great. The main group’s behind you and you’re going to come out of this forest soon, but there’s a… yeah. Well, I… I can’t think of a phrase that’s not “small army of zombies.” Sorry, don’t do so well under massive pressure. There’s a… one of those directly to the east of the trees. So, if you head more towards the old sawmill, you should be able to see its massive red signs from where you are. Man, look at that. They’re changing direction! They can… you can hear me! Okay, okay, we can keep you safe. It’s cool. It’s cool, we can bring you in. No, no, we can’t ask them that. They might be injured. All the more reason to ask them then. This is Dr. Meyers, the only medic here at Able Township. Lord knows I’m sorry to ask you this, but your route will take you almost past the old hospital. We know there are medical kits still there from the first wave of infection. If you could pick up even one or two, that would help us. That’s too dangerous! You know what happened to Runner 5? The zoms have all followed the noise of the crash. But what about whoever fired that rocket launcher? If someone was to kill that runner, taking an unusual route would make it even harder, not easier. I don’t want to be hard-headed, but everyone in this township earns their keep. You should be able to see the Robinson Hospital now. One of the buildings, Griffin Tower, it’s the tallest in the abandoned city. And if you can’t find anything, we might not be able to let you in when you get here.


Scene 3 

Okay, okay, that's great. You're making good time. No broken legs, I guess. Hey, listen, I'm going to call you Runner 5. Um, just 'cause I don't know your name and we just lost a runner in that same hospital you're running through now. She was so fast and really funny and clever. Me and her were sort of... she was amazing. But hey, you could be our new Runner 5. If you make it back alive.

Yeah, um, the runners are pretty important to keeping us going here. Any fuel we have goes to working the generators, and the truth is, if you've got two legs and you can go above a slow shamble, you'll be able to stay out of the zoms' way. Am I right?

Yeah, okay. Your pace is good, but um, maybe head through the ground floor of the hospital. There's a little swarm gathering in the parking lot I don't like the look of and um, yeah, yeah, that's good. You could even pick up anything interesting you pass. We think there might be some, oh well, we sent the old Runner 5 there looking for some file the doc's interested in, so, you know, if you find anything official-looking lying around, just bring it home.


Scene 4


Hey, there you are. I've got you on camera now. Great to see you, even though you're kind of blurry. Uh, what's that you're carrying? Look at this doc. Runner 5 picked up something in the hospital. Is that the Centers for Disease Control file? Oh, what's that?

Runner 5, I don't say this lightly, that box could be worth your life to protect. Don't drop it. What is it? It might be nothing, it might be everything. So a pretty narrow window of definition. What's that shadow over there? Oh, oh no. This was what—when we sent her out, this was what happened. They're following you, Runner 5! The swarm from the car park, they're following you now! Run!

scene 5

Man 1: This is so fast. Why are they so fast? They never run. Why are they running? Runner five. Runner five. They're gaining on you.

Woman 1: Runner five. You're not far from the gates now. If you can keep going, we'll send some people with guns out to meet you. Only one zombie is close to reaching you. Just put on a burst of speed. Now.

Man 1: God. It's her. I can see her. It's Alice. It's the old Runner Five. She's the one chasing you. She's… she's still wearing her headset.

Man 2: Runner five. It's Runner seven here, head of runners. The doctors told me you've found something useful in the hospital. We're sending out a couple of people to bring you in. Just keep running as fast as you can. Don't look back. She's right behind you. Just run.

scene 6

Man 1: This way. This way. Run.

Man 2: They're going to shoot her.

Man 3: I can't watch. I can't watch.

Woman 1: That's what she would have wanted, Sam. You know it is. She wouldn't want to be a zombie like this.

Man 1: Run, we've got to cover.

Man 2: Got her.

Woman 1: Raise the gates.

Man 1: Raise the gates.

Man 4: Welcome.

Woman 2: Great to meet you.

Man 5: Hey. Good to see you in the flesh. The totally unbroken skin not bitten by zombies flesh, right?

Woman 2: What are you doing in that helicopter anyway?

Man 5: Back, everyone. Don't crowd. Give Runner five some space. Can't take in so many new faces right now.

Man 6: Hey, you picked some med bags.

Woman 3: What do you think? Is that who they've assigned for Project Greenshoot?
