### **Episode A: The Rift**

After a successful but costly mission to retrieve schematics for new Hunter-Killer drones, **Riley** confronts **Dr. Chen** and **Maya**. Riley is angry and grief-stricken over the loss of their friend, Marcus, and questions the high price of the mission. They accuse **Anya**, the leader, of using the resistance for her own personal war and believe the mission was a reckless gamble. Maya defends the mission as a "necessary" and "calculated risk," arguing that the intel is vital for survival. The episode ends with Riley expressing profound doubt and mistrust toward both Maya and Anya, suggesting that the mission's true purpose was selfish, creating a significant rift in the group.

**Setting:** A derelict factory floor. Grime-covered machinery and rusted pipes. The sounds of a successful but costly raid echo in the background.

**Characters:** **Riley**, **Dr. Chen**, **Maya**

**Dialogue:**

**Riley:** (Panting, their breath ragged) Did you get it? The schematics? We lose four people for some old blueprints, Chen, you better tell me it was worth it. (A heavy metallic thud as a large datapad hits the floor)

**Dr. Chen:** (A strained voice) We... We did, Riley. It's all here. The full schematics for their new-gen Hunter-Killer. But... (A quiet sigh, followed by the clinking of tools against metal) But we lost Marcus. And a few others. We were lucky. (A whirring sound of a diagnostic tool)

**Maya:** (Her voice is cold, hard) Luck has nothing to do with it. This was a calculated risk. And a necessary one. This intel is invaluable. (The subtle sound of a pistol being checked and re-holstered)

**Riley:** Necessary? Maya, Marcus was a friend. He saved my life twice. And for what? For a chance to make our drones a little bit faster? (Voice rising) This was reckless. You put us all in danger for... for something Anya wanted. Her own personal war. (Slamming a hand against a metal beam)

**Dr. Chen:** Riley, that's not fair. Anya... she believed this intel could be a game-changer. We've been struggling to keep up with the Syndicate. This was our chance to get ahead. (A faint electronic hum from a datapad)

**Maya:** (Dismissive) This isn't a game, Riley. You've seen what the Administrator's patrols can do. They're relentless. If we want to win, we have to be just as ruthless. (The crackling of a long-range comms signal) This was Anya's call, yes. But I backed her on it. Every life lost was a cost we had to pay.

**Riley:** (A choked laugh, filled with disbelief) A cost? Was it really? Or was this just a way for Anya to settle old scores? (A quiet, bitter tone) You and she... you always have a plan. But lately, I'm starting to think the plan is only for your gain. Not ours. (A heavy, drawn-out silence. Only the dripping of water and the hum of the datapad are audible.)
