# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for Runners Saga Project

## 🚫 NEVER DO THIS (CRITICAL RULES):
- **NEVER suggest `flutter clean`** unless it's the absolute last resort
- **NEVER suggest full rebuilds** for simple code changes
- **NEVER waste development time** with unnecessary operations
- **NEVER forget these rules** - they've been discussed multiple times

## ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS INSTEAD:
- Use `flutter pub get` for package changes
- Use `flutter run` for testing
- Use hot reload when possible
- Fix issues incrementally
- Preserve existing working code

## 🎯 Project-Specific Context:
- This is a Flutter app with **background audio functionality**
- **Scene-based pause/unpause is already working** - don't break it
- Audio session issues should be fixed incrementally
- Focus on enabling background audio without disrupting existing features
- The app has working story triggers and scene management

## ⏰ Time Management (CRITICAL):
- **Respect development time** - don't waste 20-40 minutes on cleaning
- **Quick fixes over time-consuming rebuilds**
- **Only suggest cleaning if build cache is corrupted** (last resort)
- **Incremental development** is the goal

## 🔧 Technical Approach:
- Fix compilation errors one by one
- Test with `flutter run` after each fix
- Use `flutter pub get` for dependency updates
- Preserve working functionality while adding new features

## 📱 Current Focus:
- Enable background audio with `just_audio_background`
- Fix iOS audio session configuration
- Maintain existing scene trigger system
- Ensure audio works when app is backgrounded

## 🚨 Remember:
- **We've discussed the "no cleaning" rule multiple times**
- **Don't forget it again**
- **Development time is valuable**
- **Incremental fixes are better than nuclear options**

## 📋 Continuity Strategy (CRITICAL):
- **ALWAYS check for latest implementation plan** when starting work
- **Look for files named: `MMDD-ImplementationPlan.md`** (e.g., `0901-ImplementationPlan.md`)
- **Update implementation plan** when approaching context window limits
- **Use implementation plan** to maintain continuity between sessions
- **Never start from scratch** - always reference existing plan first
