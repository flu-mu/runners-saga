2. **Scene Trigger System**: Removed hardcoded audio files, implemented Firebase-based resolution
3. **Background Audio**: Implemented scene queuing system for background operation
4. **Audio Session**: Enhanced configuration for better background compatibility
5. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout audio playback pipeline
6. **Single Audio File Mode**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implemented complete single audio file architecture
7. **Firebase Integration**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Added robust episode data parsing with scene timestamps
8. **SceneTriggerService Restoration**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fixed corrupted service and added missing callbacks
9. **DownloadService Enhancement**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Added single audio file download support
10. **EpisodeModel Updates**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Added support for single audio file and scene timestamps
11. **Hardcoded References Removal**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Eliminated all hardcoded audio file references

### **üîÑ In Progress**
1. **Audio Playback Testing**: Need to verify single audio file mode works correctly with S01E02
2. **Background Audio Reliability**: Single audio file approach implemented but needs testing

### **‚ùå Remaining Issues**
1. **Audio Playback**: Despite implementing single audio file mode, audio still doesn't play
2. **Audio Session Errors**: Recurring `AVAudioSessionClient_Common.mm:600 Failed to set properties, error: -50` errors
3. **Local File Path Resolution**: Need to verify DownloadService correctly finds downloaded audio files

### **üéØ Next Priority (Tomorrow)**
**Focus on Audio Playback Issues**: The single audio file architecture is complete, but we need to resolve why audio isn't playing despite the implementation being correct.

## **üöÄ Tomorrow's Focus: Audio Playback Resolution**

### **Priority 1: Debug Audio Playback Pipeline**
**Goal**: Get audio playing in single audio file mode with S01E02

**Tasks**:
1. **Test S01E02 Download and Local File Access**
   - Verify episode downloads correctly from Firebase
   - Check if local file paths are resolved correctly
   - Confirm `DownloadService.getLocalEpisodeFiles()` returns expected paths

2. **Investigate Audio Session Errors**
   - Research `AVAudioSessionClient_Common.mm:600 Failed to set properties, error: -50`
   - Check iOS audio session configuration requirements
   - Verify audio session activation timing

3. **Test Single Audio File Initialization**
   - Run app with S01E02 and check console logs
   - Verify `_initializeSingleAudioFile()` completes successfully
   - Check if `_audioPlayer.setFilePath()` succeeds

### **Priority 2: Audio Player State Debugging**
**Goal**: Understand why `_audioPlayer.play()` doesn't initiate playback

**Tasks**:
1. **Add Enhanced Audio Player Logging**
   - Log audio player state changes
   - Monitor position stream updates
   - Check for audio player errors

2. **Verify Audio File Format Compatibility**
   - Test if MP3 file is compatible with `just_audio`
   - Check file encoding and format
   - Verify file size and integrity

3. **Test Audio Session Activation**
   - Ensure audio session is properly activated before playback
   - Check if background audio permissions are granted
   - Verify audio focus handling

### **Priority 3: Integration Testing**
**Goal**: Verify complete user flow works end-to-end

**Tasks**:
1. **End-to-End Test with S01E02**
   - Download episode
   - Start run session
   - Verify audio starts playing
   - Test scene triggering at progress milestones

2. **Background/Foreground Testing**
   - Test audio continues in background
   - Verify scene triggers work when app is minimized
   - Check audio resumes correctly when app returns to foreground

## **üîç Root Cause Analysis for Audio Issues**

### **Possible Causes**:
1. **Audio Session Configuration**: iOS audio session may not be configured correctly
2. **File Path Resolution**: Local file paths may not be accessible to audio player
3. **Audio File Format**: MP3 file may have compatibility issues with `just_audio`
4. **Permission Issues**: Background audio permissions may not be granted
5. **Audio Focus**: Audio focus may not be properly managed

### **Investigation Steps**:
1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages during audio initialization
2. **Verify File Access**: Confirm audio files are accessible at expected paths
3. **Test Audio Player**: Try playing a simple test audio file to isolate the issue
4. **Check Permissions**: Verify audio session permissions are granted
5. **Research Error Codes**: Look up iOS audio session error codes for guidance

## **üìã Tomorrow's Implementation Checklist**

### **Morning Session (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Test S01E02 download and local file access
- [ ] Add enhanced audio player logging
- [ ] Investigate audio session error codes
- [ ] Test audio file format compatibility

### **Afternoon Session (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Fix identified audio playback issues
- [ ] Test complete user flow with S01E02
- [ ] Verify background/foreground audio behavior
- [ ] Document any remaining issues

### **Success Criteria for Tomorrow**
1. **‚úÖ Audio Plays**: S01E02 audio starts playing when run session begins
2. **‚úÖ Scene Triggers**: Scenes trigger at correct progress milestones
3. **‚úÖ Background Audio**: Audio continues playing when app is backgrounded
4. **‚úÖ No Audio Errors**: Eliminate `AVAudioSessionClient_Common.mm:600` errors

## **üí° Technical Notes for Tomorrow**

### **Key Files to Monitor**:
- `SceneTriggerService._initializeSingleAudioFile()`
- `SceneTriggerService._startSingleAudioFilePlayback()`
- `DownloadService.getLocalEpisodeFiles()`
- Audio session configuration in `_initializeBackgroundAudio()`

### **Debug Commands**:
- Check console logs for audio initialization steps
- Monitor audio player state changes
- Verify local file paths are correct
- Test audio session activation

### **Fallback Options**:
- If single audio file mode continues to have issues, consider reverting to multiple audio files temporarily
- Test with different audio file formats (WAV instead of MP3)
- Implement audio session retry logic for failed activations

**Status**: Single audio file architecture is complete and ready for testing. Tomorrow's focus is on resolving the audio playback issues to get the system working end-to-end.
