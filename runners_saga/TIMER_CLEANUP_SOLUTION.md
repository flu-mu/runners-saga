# Timer Cleanup Solution for Hot Reload

## Problem
The app had multiple timers running that weren't being properly stopped, preventing hot reload from working. Users had to close the app completely to stop all timers.

## Root Cause
Timer stopping logic was scattered across multiple methods and wasn't comprehensive. Some timers were missed during cleanup.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Timer Cleanup Method
Created `_stopAllTimersAndServices()` method that:
- Sets all control flags immediately (`_disposed`, `_isTimerRunning`, `_isPaused`, `_timerStopped`)
- Stops all defined timers:
  - `_simpleTimer`
  - `_gpsSignalLossTimer`
  - `_paceCalculationTimer`
  - `_errorToastTimer`
  - `_networkCheckTimer`
  - `_gpsSubscription`
- Clears service callbacks
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Centralized Cleanup Points
- **`dispose()` method**: Uses comprehensive cleanup instead of scattered timer stopping
- **`_finishRun()` method**: Uses comprehensive cleanup after data is saved
- **Emergency cleanup**: Added `testTimerCleanup()` method for debugging

### 3. Timer Control Logic
All timers now check the control flags:
```dart
if (_disposed || !_isTimerRunning || _isPaused) {
  timer.cancel();
  return;
}
```

### 4. Testing Verification
Created and ran a comprehensive test that:
- Starts all timers
- Verifies they're running
- Stops all timers
- Verifies they're stopped
- Confirms no more timer output occurs

## Files Modified
- `runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_screen.dart`
  - Added `_stopAllTimersAndServices()` method
  - Updated `dispose()` method
  - Updated `_finishRun()` method
  - Added `testTimerCleanup()` method for debugging

## Benefits
1. **Hot Reload Works**: All timers are properly stopped, allowing hot reload
2. **Comprehensive**: No timers are missed during cleanup
3. **Debuggable**: Clear logging shows which timers are stopped
4. **Maintainable**: Single method handles all timer cleanup
5. **Tested**: Verified through automated testing

## Usage
The cleanup happens automatically in:
- `dispose()` - When the widget is destroyed
- `_finishRun()` - When a run is completed
- Can be called manually via `testTimerCleanup()` for debugging

## Verification
Run the app and try hot reload (press 'r' in terminal). It should work without requiring app restart.
