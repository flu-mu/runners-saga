# APP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - The Runner's Saga

## Current Status: PHASE E IN PROGRESS üöß
**Core user flow is working, but GPS tracking and data persistence need fixing**

### What's Done (Phases A-D) ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Phase A: New "Midnight Trail" theme, Episode Details screen, settings sheets
- ‚úÖ Phase B: Duration selection bottom sheet, target selection
- ‚úÖ Phase C: Run screen map panel, scene HUD, web simulation mode
- ‚úÖ Phase D: Core User Flow & Navigation - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Phase E1: Map Improvements - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### What's Working Now
- ‚úÖ Home screen with "Midnight Trail" theme and clickable "Northgate Saga" button
- ‚úÖ Season/episode selection screen with horizontal season tabs and vertical episode lists
- ‚úÖ Episode detail screen with blue background and run parameter configuration
- ‚úÖ All run parameter options (Duration, Tracking, Sprints, Music) work as bottom sheets
- ‚úÖ Sensible defaults set automatically: Duration (first option), Tracking (GPS), Sprints (Off), Music (External)
- ‚úÖ Start Workout button is active immediately with defaults
- ‚úÖ Navigation flow: Home ‚Üí Northgate ‚Üí Seasons ‚Üí Episode ‚Üí Run works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Firebase integration working (with fallback data when collections don't exist)
- ‚úÖ Audio scene triggering working during runs
- ‚úÖ App builds and runs successfully on iOS device
- ‚úÖ GPS simulation service removed (was causing confusion)
- ‚úÖ Duplicate run entries fixed
- ‚úÖ Run completion service streamlined

## CURRENT: Phase E - Enhanced Run Experience üöß
**Now that the core flow works, let's enhance the run experience**

### Phase E1: Map Improvements ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (2-3 hours)
- ‚úÖ Fixed map overflow issue (removed GPS simulation widget)
- ‚úÖ Implemented KM markers on the map
- ‚úÖ Route polyline drawing implemented
- ‚úÖ Map panel height adjusted to avoid overflow
- ‚ùå **ISSUE**: Map doesn't accurately display current GPS position
- ‚ùå **ISSUE**: GPS tracking not working properly during runs

### Phase E2: GPS Tracking & Data Persistence üöß PRIORITY FOR TOMORROW (3-4 hours)
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: GPS points not being collected during runs
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Run data not being saved to database
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Map not showing real-time position updates
- [ ] Debug GPS data collection in `ProgressMonitorService`
- [ ] Fix `_onPositionUpdate()` method logic
- [ ] Verify location permissions and `Geolocator.getPositionStream()`
- [ ] Ensure `RunSessionManager.stopSession()` saves runs with GPS data
- [ ] Test map real-time updates during runs

### Phase E3: Post-Run Experience (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create post-run summary screen
- [ ] Implement run completion flow
- [ ] Add navigation from run screen to summary
- [ ] Display run statistics and achievements

### Phase E4: Enhanced Scene Triggering (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Improve scene HUD visibility
- [ ] Add scene transition animations
- [ ] Implement better audio ducking for external music

## TOMORROW'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Priority Order)

### 1. **Fix GPS Tracking Issues** üö® CRITICAL (2-3 hours)
- **Problem**: Map doesn't accurately display current position, GPS tracking not working
- **Root Cause**: `ProgressMonitorService._onPositionUpdate()` has flawed logic
- **Solution**: 
  - Fix GPS position update logic
  - Add extensive logging to debug GPS data collection
  - Verify location permissions are working
  - Test real-time map updates

### 2. **Fix Run Data Persistence** üö® CRITICAL (1-2 hours)
- **Problem**: Test runs not being saved to database, GPS route data missing
- **Root Cause**: `RunSessionManager.stopSession()` may not be calling Firestore save methods
- **Solution**:
  - Add logging to run saving process
  - Verify `FirestoreService.saveRun()` is being called
  - Check if run model contains GPS route data

### 3. **Restore Firestore Indexes** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM (1 hour)
- **Problem**: Temporarily disabled `orderBy` clauses to avoid index errors
- **Solution**:
  - Create required composite indexes in Firebase console
  - Re-enable `orderBy('startTime', descending: true)` in queries
  - Test workout list sorting

### 4. **Performance Optimization** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM (1 hour)
- **Problem**: Workout screen loading may have performance issues
- **Solution**:
  - Check Firestore query optimization
  - Verify pagination is working
  - Test with different amounts of run data

---

## Technical Achievements in Phase E
- **GPS Simulation Removal**: Eliminated confusing GPS simulation service
- **Duplicate Run Fix**: Consolidated run saving to single point (`RunSessionManager`)
- **Map Panel Fixes**: Resolved overflow issues and improved route display
- **Build Stability**: App now builds and runs successfully on iOS
- **Audio System**: Scene triggering and audio playback working during runs

## Current Blockers
1. **GPS Tracking**: `ProgressMonitorService` not collecting GPS points properly
2. **Data Persistence**: Runs not being saved to Firestore database
3. **Map Accuracy**: Map not showing real-time position updates
4. **Firestore Indexes**: Need to create composite indexes for proper sorting

## Expected Outcome After Tomorrow
Users should be able to:
1. ‚úÖ Start a run and see real-time GPS tracking
2. ‚úÖ See their position accurately displayed on the map
3. ‚úÖ Have their run data saved with GPS route
4. ‚úÖ View completed runs in workout list (properly sorted)
5. ‚úÖ See accurate distance and time tracking during runs

## Original Phases (Resume After Phase E)
### Phase F: Polish & Performance
- [ ] UI refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User testing feedback
