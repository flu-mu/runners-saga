# APP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - The Runner's Saga

## Current Status: PHASE D COMPLETED ✅
**Core user flow is now working end-to-end with real Firebase data and proper theming**

### What's Done (Phases A-D)
- ✅ Phase A: New "Midnight Trail" theme, Episode Details screen, settings sheets
- ✅ Phase B: Duration selection bottom sheet, target selection
- ✅ Phase C: Run screen map panel, scene HUD, web simulation mode
- ✅ Phase D: Core User Flow & Navigation - COMPLETED

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Home screen with "Midnight Trail" theme and clickable "Abel Township Saga" button
- ✅ Season/episode selection screen with horizontal season tabs and vertical episode lists
- ✅ Episode detail screen with blue background and run parameter configuration
- ✅ All run parameter options (Duration, Tracking, Sprints, Music) work as bottom sheets
- ✅ Sensible defaults set automatically: Duration (first option), Tracking (GPS), Sprints (Off), Music (External)
- ✅ Start Workout button is active immediately with defaults
- ✅ Navigation flow: Home → Abel Township → Seasons → Episode → Run works end-to-end
- ✅ Firebase integration working (with fallback data when collections don't exist)
- ✅ Audio scene triggering working during runs

- ✅ Implement episode list with thumbnails and descriptions
- ✅ Load real episode data from Firebase
- ✅ Navigation from Abel Township button to this screen
- ✅ Episode selection leads to existing Episode Details screen

### Phase D3: Data Integration & Audio ✅ (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Ensure Episode Details loads real Firebase data
- ✅ Verify audio download system works with real episodes
- ✅ Test run parameter selection flow
- ✅ Validate run screen can access episode data and audio

### Phase D4: End-to-End Testing ✅ (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Test complete flow: Home → Abel Township → Episode → Run
- ✅ Verify Firebase data loads correctly
- ✅ Test audio playback during runs
- ✅ Fix any navigation or data issues

## Next Priority: Phase E - Enhanced Run Experience
**Now that the core flow works, let's enhance the run experience**

### Phase E1: Map Improvements (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Fix map overflow issue (currently showing 551px overflow error)
- [ ] Implement KM markers on the map
- [ ] Ensure route polyline draws immediately and is visible
- [ ] Adjust map panel height to avoid overflow

### Phase E2: Post-Run Experience (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create post-run summary screen
- [ ] Implement run completion flow
- [ ] Add navigation from run screen to summary
- [ ] Display run statistics and achievements

### Phase E3: Enhanced Scene Triggering (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Improve scene HUD visibility
- [ ] Add scene transition animations
- [ ] Implement better audio ducking for external music

---

## Original Phases (Resume After Phase E)
### Phase F: Polish & Performance
- [ ] UI refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User testing feedback

---

## Technical Achievements in Phase D
- **Theme Consistency**: All screens now use the "Midnight Trail" blue background theme
- **Bottom Sheet Integration**: Run parameters are now proper bottom sheets that slide up from the episode detail screen
- **Default Values**: All options have sensible defaults so the Start Workout button is active immediately
- **Navigation Flow**: Complete user journey from home to run is working
- **Firebase Integration**: Real data loading with graceful fallbacks for missing collections
- **Audio System**: Scene triggering and audio playback working during runs

## Expected Outcome
Users can now:
1. ✅ Open app and see home screen with blue theme
2. ✅ Click "Abel Township Saga" 
3. ✅ Browse seasons and episodes
4. ✅ Select Episode 1
5. ✅ Configure run parameters (with sensible defaults)
6. ✅ Start run with real episode data and audio

**This gives us a working MVP that we can now enhance with the remaining features.**
