# Implementation Plan - September 6th, 2025 (0906)

## üìÖ Document Information
- Date: September 6th, 2025
- Document ID: 0906 (MM=09, DD=06)
- Previous Plan: 0905-ImplementationPlan.md (September 5th, 2024)
- Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Today‚Äôs Objectives
- Fix GPS points loss at save time
- Ensure a second run can start without app restart
- Show correct run status in history for new and legacy docs
- Apply Settings (distance/pace/speed/energy) across main views
- Stop unnecessary re-download prompts for episodes (S01E03)
- Reduce analyzer noise (quick cleanups)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1) GPS Preservation & Save Flow
- Cached GPS data and stats BEFORE stopping services, then saved using the preserved data.
- Added clear logs to verify caching and saving.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_screen.dart (updated `_finishRun()`)
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/run_completion_service.dart (uses captured GPS list)

Verification
- Logs show: ‚Äú‚úÖ GPS DATA PRESERVATION: Cached N points‚Äù and Firestore save with non-empty `gpsPoints`.
- Document created in `runs` with route and distance.

### 2) Run Completion Status & History Derivation
- Marked saved runs as `status: completed` in the completion service.
- Derived status for legacy rows in history (completedAt ‚Üí Completed, else time>0 ‚Üí In Progress, else Not Started).
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/run_completion_service.dart (set `status: RunStatus.completed`)
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_history_screen.dart (derived status + badge)

### 3) Start Another Run Without Restart
- Added `prepareForNewRun()` to reset stop flags and session activity.
- Called at the start of `_startRun()` so a new run can begin after finishing.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/run_session_manager.dart (added method, ensured session inactive on nuclearStop)
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/providers/run_session_providers.dart (exposed `prepareForNewRun()`)
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_screen.dart (invoke before starting)

### 4) Settings Integration (Distance / Pace / Speed / Energy)
- Run Details: distance and pace now formatted via `SettingsService` (km‚Üîmi, min/km‚Üîmin/mi).
- Run History (list + modal): distance/pace/energy use `SettingsService` consistently.
- Pace Details tab: fully dynamic headers and values per user unit.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_details_screen.dart
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_history_screen.dart

### 5) Dynamic Splits (km or mi) + Split Size Toggle
- Splits computed per unit (1 km or 1 mi) based on settings.
- Added 1√ó and 5√ó split-length toggle (e.g., 1 mi / 5 mi or 1 km / 5 km).
- Table headers show the correct unit (‚Äúmi‚Äù|‚Äúkm‚Äù and ‚ÄúPace (mi|km)‚Äù).
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_history_screen.dart (dynamic header, `_calculateSplitSegments`, toggle)

### 6) Episode Download Recognition (S01E03)
- Robust filename extraction for Firebase URLs (both `firebasestorage.app` and `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`).
- Downloads now save using correct filenames; cache checks recognize existing files.
- Added lenient fallback: if strict check fails but any audio files exist, mark as cached to avoid unnecessary prompts.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/audio/download_service.dart
  - runners_saga/lib/features/story/screens/episode_detail_screen.dart

### 7) Quick Analyzer Cleanups
- Removed/adjusted unused or duplicate imports in several files.
- No functional changes; reduced noise for future work.

### 8) Cursor Rules
- Added: ‚ÄúAlways test the build after modifying code (quick compile)‚Äù.
- File: runners_saga/.cursorrules

---

## üß™ Validation Summary
- Dart analyzer runs without errors; remaining warnings are non-blocking (unused locals/null-aware noise).
- Firestore logs confirm run saves with GPS and correct status.
- History page badges show COMPLETED for new and legacy docs.
- Settings toggles update distance/pace/energy formatting consistently.
- S01E03 no longer repeatedly prompts for downloads when files exist.

### 9) Live Run Map Polyline Rendering
- Fixed live map not drawing the route during an active run.
- The map now rebuilds on route updates by watching `currentRunStatsProvider` and uses its `route` for the polyline.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/widgets/run_map_panel.dart

### 10) Background Audio & Scene Triggers (Background)
- Restored background scene triggering so scenes play while the app is backgrounded.
- Wired `ProgressMonitorService` to `SceneTriggerService` so the background progress timer updates scene triggers in background.
- Verified background capabilities are configured (Android foreground service `mediaPlayback`, iOS `UIBackgroundModes` `audio`).
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/run_session_manager.dart (connects `_progressMonitor.setSceneTriggerService(_sceneTrigger)`)
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/progress_monitor_service.dart (background progress loop already in place)

---

### 11) Run Summary Stats (Distance / Pace / Calories)
- Fixed summary stats showing 0.00 for distance, pace, and calories.
- Finish Run now pulls final distance/time from `RunSessionManager.getCurrentStats()` instead of local screen fields.
- Calories are computed via MET using user weight from settings (fallback 70kg) inside `RunCompletionService`.
- Files:
  - runners_saga/lib/features/run/screens/run_screen.dart (finish flow uses live session stats)
  - runners_saga/lib/shared/services/run/run_completion_service.dart (MET calorie calc + weight provider)

---

## üìå Follow-ups (Nice-to-have)
- Backfill `status: completed` on older run documents (one-time maintenance script).
- Optional: Add custom split sizes (e.g., 0.5 mi/km, 2 km, etc.).
- Tidy remaining analyzer warnings (unused locals) as a dedicated cleanup pass.

## üöÄ Status
All objectives for 0906 are COMPLETE. ‚úÖ
