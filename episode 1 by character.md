### COMMANDER MORRISON
* "Alright, listen up, rookie. Riley, right? Used to run track before the world went to hell?"
* "Kid, in this world, being fast is the difference between living and becoming lunch. Maya, bring our newbie up to speed."
* "Here's your route, rookie. [Pointing] Two miles northeast to Pinewood Mall. Supply cache is in the old GameStop - medicines, canned goods, batteries. Should be a straight shot through residential streets."
* "[Concerned] Faster how?"
* "[Into radio] Copy, Dr. Chen. Morrison here."
* "[Concerned but proud] Riley! Report!"
* "[Serious] Tell me everything."
* "[Into radio] Affirmative, Doctor. Full success, but we've confirmed the runner zombie reports."
* "[Looking at Riley with new respect] Dr. Chen's working on something big down there. Something that could change everything. But she needs materials, and we need someone fast enough to get them to her."
* "[Final] Damn right you are. Get some rest, rookie. Tomorrow we start planning something bigger."

### RILEY
* "Yes sir. State championships, 800 meter. Though I guess that doesn't count for much now."
* "How many... how many are out there?"
* "[Quietly] Great. My first day and the zombies got an upgrade."
* "[Taking deep breath] Let's do this."
* "[Breathing controlled] This feels surreal. Six months ago I was worried about midterms."
* "Pre-med. Wanted to help people, you know? Guess I still am, just... differently."
* "[Whispered] To our right. Behind the overturned car."
* "My dad. He said running was the most honest sport - just you against yourself, no equipment, no teammates to blame. Never thought it would literally save my life."
* "[Startled] What was that?"
* "[Panic creeping in] Maya, something's coming through the hedge!"
* "[Breathing hard] What are those things?! They're keeping up!"
* "[Terrified] IT JUMPED! IT ACTUALLY JUMPED AT ME!"
* "[Breathing heavily] That... that slowed them down!"
* "There's more of them! A whole pack!"
* "[Amazed despite danger] Look at this place. It's like a tomb."
* "[Looking back] They're at the entrance, but they can't figure out how to open the doors!"
* "[Breathing easier] We're almost there. I can see the GameStop sign."
* "[At GameStop entrance] The security gate's down! How do we get in?"
* "[Focused] Medical kit, batteries, canned food... Maya, there's enough here for weeks!"
* "[Confused] I thought you said the runners were stupid?"
* "[Packing supplies] How many exits are there?"
* "[Looking up] That's got to be twenty feet up!"
* "[Climbing] This is insane! I can't believe I'm doing this!"
* "[From above] I'm not leaving you!"
* "[Breathing hard, emotional] Maya! Maya, respond!"
* "[Exhausted but triumphant] Mission accomplished, sir. Medical supplies, batteries, enough food for three days. But Commander... Tommy was right about the runners."
* "[Relieved] Maya! How did you get out?"
* "[Curious] Supply line?"
* "[Reflective] Six months ago, the biggest risk I took was choosing between pizza or Chinese food. Now I'm literally running for people's lives."
* "[Confident] Then I guess I'm a runner."
* "[Narrator's internal voice] Day one was supposed to be simple. A milk run, Maya called it. But nothing's simple anymore. Every step forward is a step toward hope, and every mile I run brings us closer to finding our way back. The infected are evolving, but so are we. And tomorrow? Tomorrow we run again."

### MAYA
* "Riley, welcome to the Corps. I'm Ghost - call me Maya. Been doing this for eight months now. First rule: the infected are predictable. They're slow, they're stupid, and they follow sound. It's the living you gotta watch out for."
* "In the suburbs? Maybe two, three hundred scattered around. Downtown's worse - thousands packed in like sardines. But today's milk run. Simple supply cache retrieval."
* "Thanks, kid. Riley, Tommy's our eyes and ears. Smart little scout."
* "[Reassuring] Stick with me, follow my lead, and you'll be fine. Ready to save some lives?"
* "[Via earpiece, breathing slightly heavy] Stay close, maintain this pace. See that house with the blue door? Three shamblers in the yard, but they're facing away. We're invisible if we're quiet."
* "What were you studying?"
* "[Whispered] Hold up. You hear that?"
* "Good eye. It's alone, moving away from us. Let's give it space and keep moving."
* "So what got you into running?"
* "[Slight laugh] Mine too. Corporate security before all this. Spent more time in boardrooms than outdoors. Amazing how the apocalypse can improve your cardio."
* "[Alert] That wasn't a shambler. Riley, we might have a problem."
* "[Urgent] Run! NOW! Forget stealth - GO GO GO!"
* "[Winded but focused] Runner zombies! Tommy was right - they're evolving! Don't look back, just run!"
* "[Shouting] Shopping carts! Use the shopping carts!"
* "[Catching breath] Runner zombies are fast but clumsy. Obstacles confuse them. The mall's just ahead - we need to get inside."
* "[Determined] The entrance - those glass doors. We get inside, they'll have to funnel through. Gives us an advantage."
* "[Cautious] Mall's not empty. Hear that? Standard shamblers deeper in, but they're slow. The runners are our immediate problem."
* "[Relieved] See? Fast but stupid. We've got maybe two minutes before they find another way in or break through. GameStop's on the second level - let's move."
* "[Into radio] Thanks for the eyes, Tommy. How many?"
* "[Urgent] They're in! Move faster!"
* "[Urgent] Check for a service entrance - there! Behind the counter!"
* "[Distant shouting from mall] Take what you can carry! We've got company!"
* "[Grim realization] The regular shamblers are following them up! The noise is attracting everything in the building!"
* "[Thinking fast] Service corridors behind the food court, but we'd have to cross the main floor. Or... the skylight Tommy mentioned."
* "[Determined] Grab that mannequin, we'll stack displays to reach the ceiling panels. Sometimes crazy is the only way out."
* "[Below, defensive] Just keep climbing! I'll hold them off!"
* "[Shouting] RILEY! GO! GET OUT OF HERE!"
* "[Fighting sounds below] The supplies are what matter! People are counting on us!"
* "[Via radio, breathless but alive] I'm okay! Found another way out! Meet you back at base!"
* "[Slightly winded] Miss me?"
* "[Casual] Service tunnel behind the pretzel stand. Led straight to the parking garage. Though I did have to explain to a very confused shambler why I was in his personal space."
* "[Grinning] Looks like the rookie's officially graduated."
* "[Wise] Funny how the world ending can show you who you really are."

### TOMMY
* "Riley! Riley! I mapped the area yesterday from the water tower. Most of the infected are on the main roads, but there's a cluster near the playground."
* "I counted forty-three shamblers between here and the mall. Oh, and there's something weird - some of them were moving faster than usual."
* "Like... jogging speed? Never seen that before."
* "[Via radio, excited] Riley! Maya! I can see you through the skylight! There are runners circling the building, but the main group's still trying to get through the front!"
* "I count... eight runners outside, maybe a dozen shamblers inside the mall, but they're all on the ground floor."
* "[Via radio, panicked] Guys! The whole mall's lighting up! Every infected inside is moving toward your location!"
* "[Via radio] Riley! You made it! Slide down the loading dock roof - I can see a clear path home!"
* "[Excited] You should have seen it from up there! Riley went through the roof like some kind of action hero!"

### DR. CHEN
* "[Via radio, slightly distorted] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen, Atlanta Safe Zone. Do you copy?"
* "Commander, we've been tracking some unusual infected behavior. Reports of increased mobility, basic problem-solving. Your people need to be extra careful out there."
* "[Via radio] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen. Did you recover the medical supplies?"
* "[Concerned] That's... troubling. We're seeing similar evolution patterns here in Atlanta. Commander, I need to speak with your team about establishing a more regular supply line."
* "[Via radio, hopeful] Riley, is it? Welcome to the fight. What we're working on here... it could save everyone. Every run you make brings us closer to ending this nightmare."
