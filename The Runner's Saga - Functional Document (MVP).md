### **Project: The Runner's Saga \- Functional Document (MVP)**

**Document Version:** 1.0 **Date:** Sunday, August 10, 2025

#### **1\. Introduction**

**1.1. Project Overview** "The Runner's Saga" is a mobile application designed for iOS and Android that aims to revolutionize the running experience. Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus solely on metrics, our application integrates compelling, audio-based narratives to transform a routine workout into an immersive adventure. The app's core value proposition is to make running a habit-forming activity through storytelling, and this document outlines the functional specifications for the initial MVP.

**1.2. Business Goals**

* **Primary Goal:** Validate the market demand for a story-driven running experience.  
* **Secondary Goal:** Establish a reliable and scalable monetization model (one-time purchase).  
* **Tertiary Goal:** Build a foundation for future expansion into multiple genres and a subscription-based revenue model.

**1.3. User Personas**

* **"The Habit-Builder":** A new runner who struggles with motivation. They need an external reason to get out the door. The app's narrative will be their primary motivator.  
* **"The Gamer-Runner":** An avid gamer who wants to be more active. They are drawn to the app's gamified elements like "loot," "quests," and "achievements." They appreciate a well-written story and polished game mechanics.  
* **"The Story Listener":** Someone who enjoys audiobooks or podcasts. They are looking for high-quality audio content that they can enjoy while running, and the fitness tracking is a secondary but welcome feature.

* **Requirement 2.2.4:** The app **must** handle background running, so the tracking continues even if the user switches to another app or the screen is locked.

**2.3. The "Fantasy Quest" Saga**

* **Requirement 2.3.1:** The app **must** include a complete saga structured as seasons, where each season contains 8-10 episodes.  
* **Requirement 2.3.2:** The app **must** automatically progress users through episodes in sequence. For the MVP with one episode (S01E01), users start directly with the first episode. When additional episodes are added, the app will automatically load the next available episode without requiring user selection.  
* **Requirement 2.3.3:** The app **must** require users to choose either a target time or distance before starting their run to properly space out story scenes. Distance targets are provided in kilometers (5 km, 10 km, 15 km) with time targets in minutes (15, 30, 60).

* **Requirement 2.3.3.1:** Episode progression **must** be automatic and sequential. Users should not be required to manually select episodes. The app should automatically load the next available episode in the sequence after completing the current one.  
* **Requirement 2.3.4:** The app **must** be able to play music from the user's device while the episode is in progress.  
* **Requirement 2.3.5:** The app **must** be able to seamlessly interrupt the user's music by reducing volume to a bare minimum when story scenes are due to play, ensuring dialogue clarity.  
* **Requirement 2.3.6:** The app **must** automatically trigger story scenes at predetermined intervals based on the user's chosen time/distance, with the first scene playing at the beginning and subsequent scenes spaced throughout the run.  
* **Requirement 2.3.7:** The app **must** have a mechanism to trigger "sprint intervals" within the story, where the user is prompted to increase their pace. The story's outcome will be affected by the user's pace during this interval.

**2.4. Saga Content Structure**

* **Requirement 2.4.1:** Each episode **must** be structured as a series of 5 scenes that play at predetermined intervals during one complete run.
* **Requirement 2.4.2:** Scene 1 **must** play at the beginning of the run to set the narrative context.
* **Requirement 2.4.3:** Scenes 2-4 **must** be spaced evenly throughout the run based on the user's chosen time or distance target.
* **Requirement 2.4.4:** Scene 5 **must** play toward the end of the run to provide narrative conclusion and episode completion.
* **Requirement 2.4.5:** Each scene **must** be delivered as a high-quality audio file (.wav format) stored in the app's assets.
* **Requirement 2.4.6:** The app **must** automatically calculate scene timing based on the user's pre-run selection of target time or distance.
* **Requirement 2.4.7:** The app **must** use a clear naming convention: S01E01 for Season 1 Episode 1, where each season contains 8-10 episodes.
* **Requirement 2.4.8:** Each episode **must** be a complete story that happens during one run, with 5 scenes that progress the narrative from beginning to end.

#### **3\. User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)**

This section describes the visual design and user flow for the key screens of the app. The design philosophy is clean, minimalist, and immersive, with a focus on ease of use.

**3.1. Onboarding Flow**

* **Screen 1: Welcome:** A visually stunning splash screen with the app's logo and a tagline like "Your Run. Your Story." A single, prominent button will read "Start Your Journey."  
* **Screen 2: Account Creation:** A clean and simple screen for email/password signup or social login buttons. The focus is on getting the user in quickly.  
* **Screen 3: Story Intro:** A short, animated sequence or a captivating, high-quality image that sets the scene for the first saga (e.g., a fantasy map with a glowing path). This screen will have a simple "Choose Your Saga" button.

**3.2. The Home Screen (Saga Hub)**

* **Purpose:** This will be the user's central hub for all activities.  
* **Layout:** A clean, visual-first design. The top of the screen will display a summary of the user's overall progress (e.g., "Hero Level 3"). Below this, a large, interactive map of the "Fantasy Quest" saga will dominate the screen.  
* **Interactive Elements:** Each completed episode will be a lit-up point on the map, with the next episode's point glowing and pulsating to draw the user's attention. Tapping an episode point will lead to the "Episode Details" screen.

**3.3. The Run Screen**

* **Purpose:** To provide essential information during a run without being distracting.  
* **Layout:** Minimalist design with a dark theme to be easy on the eyes. The background will be a subtle, looping animation related to the saga (e.g., a gentle forest scene).  
* **Key Metrics:** Real-time stats (distance, time, pace) will be displayed in a prominent, easy-to-read font.  
* **Story Status:** A small visual indicator will show whether a story segment is playing or music is active. During "action" segments (e.g., a sprint interval), the screen will flash with a subtle color (e.g., red) to add to the immersion.

**3.4. Post-Run Summary**

* **Purpose:** To celebrate the user's accomplishment and show their progress in the saga.  
* **Layout:** The primary focus is a congratulatory message, e.g., "Episode Complete: You have escaped the dragon's lair\!" The screen will then show key stats, a map of the run, and a list of items or "loot" collected during the run. A large, shareable image of the run will be a prominent feature.

#### **4\. Technical Architecture and Stack**

This section defines the core technologies and how they will interact to deliver the app's functionality. The architecture is designed to be scalable, efficient, and cost-effective, leveraging a serverless approach.

**4.1. Frontend**

* **Framework:** **Flutter**. This will be used to build a single codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a consistent UI and a faster development cycle.  
* **Language:** **Dart**.  
* **State Management:** **Riverpod**. This will be used for a clean and efficient way to manage application state, making the code easier to maintain and test.  
* **Key Packages:**  
  * `geolocator`: For accurate GPS tracking and location services.  
  * `flutter_map` or `Maps_flutter`: For displaying the run's route on a map.  
  * `audioplayers`: To handle audio playback for both music and story segments.  
  * `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`: For seamless integration with the Firebase backend.  
  * `go_router`: For managing app navigation and deep linking.

**4.2. Backend**

* **Platform:** **Firebase**. This serverless platform will be the core of the app's backend.  
* **Database:** **Cloud Firestore**. This NoSQL database will store all user-related data, including:  
  * `users`: Collection for user profiles and authentication data.  
  * `runs`: Collection to store detailed information for each run (distance, time, route).  
  * `sagas`: Collection to store the metadata for the sagas and their episodes.  
  * `progress`: Collection to track a user's progress through a specific saga.  
* **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication**. This will handle all user sign-ups and logins, including social login providers.  
* **Cloud Storage:** **Firebase Cloud Storage**. This will be used to host and serve all the high-quality audio files for the sagas and any user-uploaded content (e.g., profile pictures).  
* **Cloud Functions:** **Cloud Functions for Firebase**. This will be used for all server-side logic, including:  
  * **Dynamic Story Generation:** A function that, given a user's run length and pace, assembles the correct audio segments for an episode.  
  * **Data Processing:** Functions to process run data after completion and update the user's saga progress.  
  * **Scheduled Events:** Functions to handle future features like daily quests or episodes.

**4.3. Data Flow**

1. User starts a run on the Flutter frontend.  
2. The app uses `geolocator` to track the user and `audioplayers` to play music and story segments.  
3. Upon completion, the app sends the run data (GPS path, time, etc.) to a Cloud Function.  
4. The Cloud Function processes the data and updates the user's `runs` and `progress` collections in Firestore.  
5. When a user opens the "Saga Hub," the Flutter frontend retrieves the latest saga progress from Firestore and displays it on the map.
