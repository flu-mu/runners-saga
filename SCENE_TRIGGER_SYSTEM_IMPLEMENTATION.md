# Scene Trigger Points System Implementation

## Overview
The Scene Trigger Points system has been successfully implemented for The Runner's Saga app, providing a sophisticated story-driven running experience that automatically plays audio scenes at specific progress milestones during runs.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ **WORKING IN FOREGROUND**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- **Scene Trigger System**: Properly triggers scenes sequentially at progress points (0%, 20%, 40%, 70%, 90%)
- **Audio Playback**: Scenes play one at a time in correct order
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress calculation using both time and distance metrics
- **Background Timer**: Timer continues running when app is backgrounded
- **GPS Tracking**: Location points are being collected and stored
- **Background Services**: Core background functionality is operational

### ⚠️ **Current Limitations:**
- **Scene Triggers**: Only work when app is in foreground
- **Audio Scenes**: Do not automatically trigger in background
- **Story Continuity**: User must keep app open to experience full story progression

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Services

#### Progress Monitor Service (`progress_monitor_service.dart`) ✅ **WORKING**
- **Purpose**: Real-time tracking of run progress using both time and distance metrics
- **Features**:
  - GPS location tracking with high accuracy
  - Real-time distance calculation
  - Pace monitoring (current, average, max, min)
  - Progress calculation based on time vs. distance targets
  - Automatic fallback to time-based progress if GPS fails
  - Background GPS persistence and state management

#### Scene Trigger Service (`scene_trigger_service.dart`) ✅ **WORKING IN FOREGROUND**
- **Purpose**: Manages the timing and playback of story scenes
- **Features**:
  - Scene trigger points at specific progress percentages:
    - Scene 1 (Mission Briefing): 0% - Start of run
    - Scene 2 (The Journey): 20% of total distance/time
    - Scene 3 (First Contact): 40% of total distance/time
    - Scene 4 (The Crisis): 70% of total distance/time
    - Scene 5 (Extraction/Debrief): 90% of total distance/time
  - Prevents overlapping scenes
  - Tracks played scenes to avoid repetition
  - Automatic audio file selection based on scene type
  - Single scene triggering (no simultaneous playback)

#### Audio Manager (`audio_manager.dart`) ✅ **WORKING**
- **Purpose**: Handles all audio operations with professional-grade features
- **Features**:
  - Multiple audio players (background music, story audio, SFX)
  - Smooth fade transitions (500ms fade in/out)
  - Crossfade between background music tracks
  - Audio queue management
  - Volume control per audio type
  - Error handling and fallbacks

#### Run Session Manager (`run_session_manager.dart`) ✅ **WORKING**
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all services for unified run session management
- **Features**:
  - Session lifecycle management (start, pause, resume, stop, complete)
  - Service coordination and state synchronization
  - Progress monitoring integration
  - Scene trigger coordination
  - Background music management
  - Run statistics compilation

### 2. Background Functionality ✅ **WORKING**

#### Background Service Manager (`background_service_manager.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Manages native background services for continuous tracking
- **Features**:
  - Android background service integration
  - iOS background app refresh support
  - Continuous GPS tracking in background
  - Timer continuation when app is backgrounded

#### Background Timer Manager (`background_timer_manager.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures timers continue running in background
- **Features**:
  - Timer state persistence across app lifecycle changes
  - Background timer continuation
  - State restoration when app returns to foreground

#### App Lifecycle Manager (`app_lifecycle_manager.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates app lifecycle changes across all services
- **Features**:
  - App background/foreground detection
  - Service state management during lifecycle changes
  - Audio pause/resume for background transitions
  - Background service coordination

## Current User Experience

### ✅ **Working Features:**
1. **Run Start**: User selects target and starts run
2. **Scene 1 (0%)**: Mission Briefing plays immediately
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time distance, time, and pace updates
4. **Scene 2 (20%)**: The Journey triggers at 20% progress
5. **Scene 3 (40%)**: First Contact triggers at 40% progress
6. **Scene 4 (70%)**: The Crisis triggers at 70% progress
7. **Scene 5 (90%)**: Extraction/Debrief triggers at 90% progress
8. **Background Continuity**: Timer and GPS continue in background
9. **State Persistence**: Run data is saved and can be resumed

### ⚠️ **User Experience Gaps:**
1. **Story Interruption**: If user backgrounds app, story scenes stop triggering
2. **Manual Progression**: User must return to foreground to continue story
3. **Background Audio**: No automatic scene progression in background

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scene Trigger Logic ✅ **WORKING**
```dart
/// Check if any scenes should be triggered
void _checkSceneTriggers() {
  for (final entry in _sceneTriggers.entries) {
    final sceneType = entry.key;
    final triggerPoint = entry.value;
    
    // Skip if scene already played or is currently playing
    if (_playedScenes.contains(sceneType) || _currentScene == sceneType) {
      continue;
    }
    
    // Check if we've reached the trigger point
    if (_currentProgress >= triggerPoint) {
      _triggerScene(sceneType);
      break; // Only trigger one scene at a time
    }
  }
}
```

### Progress Calculation ✅ **WORKING**
```dart
/// Calculate current progress based on time and distance
void _calculateProgress() {
  double timeProgress = _elapsedTime.inSeconds / _targetTime.inSeconds;
  double distanceProgress = _totalDistance / _targetDistance;
  
  // Use the higher progress value to ensure scenes trigger appropriately
  _currentProgress = (timeProgress > distanceProgress ? timeProgress : distanceProgress).clamp(0.0, 1.0);
}
```

### Background GPS Tracking ✅ **WORKING**
```dart
/// Ensure GPS tracking is active in background
void _ensureGpsTrackingActive() {
  if (_positionStream?.isPaused == true) {
    _positionStream?.resume();
  }
  
  if (_gpsBackupTimer?.isActive != true) {
    _startGpsBackupTimer();
  }
}
```
