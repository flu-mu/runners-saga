# Scene Trigger Points System Implementation

## Overview
The Scene Trigger Points system has been successfully implemented for The Runner's Saga app, providing a sophisticated story-driven running experience that automatically plays audio scenes at specific progress milestones during runs.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Services

#### Progress Monitor Service (`progress_monitor_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Real-time tracking of run progress using both time and distance metrics
- **Features**:
  - GPS location tracking with high accuracy
  - Real-time distance calculation
  - Pace monitoring (current, average, max, min)
  - Progress calculation based on time vs. distance targets
  - Automatic fallback to time-based progress if GPS fails

#### Scene Trigger Service (`scene_trigger_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Manages the timing and playback of story scenes
- **Features**:
  - Scene trigger points at specific progress percentages:
    - Scene 1 (Mission Briefing): 0% - Start of run
    - Scene 2 (The Journey): 20% of total distance/time
    - Scene 3 (First Contact): 40% of total distance/time
    - Scene 4 (The Crisis): 70% of total distance/time
    - Scene 5 (Extraction/Debrief): 90% of total distance/time
  - Prevents overlapping scenes
  - Tracks played scenes to avoid repetition
  - Automatic audio file selection based on scene type

#### Audio Manager (`audio_manager.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all audio operations with professional-grade features
- **Features**:
  - Multiple audio players (background music, story audio, SFX)
  - Smooth fade transitions (500ms fade in/out)
  - Crossfade between background music tracks
  - Audio queue management
  - Volume control per audio type
  - Error handling and fallbacks

#### Run Session Manager (`run_session_manager.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all services for unified run session management
- **Features**:
  - Session lifecycle management (start, pause, resume, stop, complete)
  - Service coordination and state synchronization
  - Progress monitoring integration
  - Scene trigger coordination
  - Background music management
  - Run statistics compilation

### 2. State Management

#### Riverpod Providers (`run_session_providers.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Provides reactive state management for the UI
- **Providers**:
  - `RunSessionController`: Main controller for run sessions
  - `CurrentRunSession`: Current session state
  - `CurrentRunProgress`: Real-time progress updates
  - `CurrentRunStats`: Comprehensive run statistics
  - `CurrentScene`: Currently playing scene
  - `PlayedScenes`: List of completed scenes
  - `CurrentRunEpisode`: Episode being run
  - `CompletedRun`: Final run data

### 3. User Interface Integration

#### Run Screen Updates (`run_screen.dart`)
- **Scene Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar with scene markers
- **Scene Status Display**: Shows currently playing scene
- **Progress Visualization**: Percentage-based progress tracking
- **Scene Markers**: Visual indicators for each scene trigger point
- **Real-time Stats**: Live updates of distance, pace, and time
- **Scene Notifications**: Floating action button for current scene
- **Automatic Start**: Run session begins immediately when screen loads

## Technical Features

### Progress Calculation
- **Dual Metric System**: Uses both time and distance for accurate progress tracking
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically switches to time-based progress if GPS fails
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates every second during active runs

### Scene Queue Management
- **Sequential Playback**: Ensures scenes play in order without overlap
- **Completion Tracking**: Prevents scene repetition within a single run
- **State Persistence**: Maintains scene state across pause/resume cycles

### Audio Fade Transitions
- **Smooth Fades**: 500ms fade in/out for all audio transitions
- **Crossfade Support**: Seamless background music transitions
- **Volume Management**: Independent volume control for different audio types

### Fallback Triggers
- **Distance-based Fallback**: If time-based triggers fail, distance-based triggers activate
- **GPS Redundancy**: Multiple location accuracy levels for reliable tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Scene Trigger Points

| Scene | Trigger Point | Audio File | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Mission Briefing | 0% | `scene_1_mission_briefing.wav` | Run start, mission overview |
| The Journey | 20% | `scene_2_the_journey.wav` | Adventure begins, first challenges |
| First Contact | 40% | `scene_3_first_contact.wav` | Discovery moment, plot development |
| The Crisis | 70% | `scene_4_the_crisis.wav` | Climactic challenge, tension peak |
| Extraction/Debrief | 90% | `scene_5_extraction_debrief.wav` | Mission completion, story resolution |

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. User Experience
- **Immersive Storytelling**: Seamless integration of story with physical activity
- **Progress Motivation**: Visual feedback keeps users engaged
- **Audio Quality**: Professional-grade audio transitions enhance immersion
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking maintains engagement

### 2. Technical Robustness
- **Service Architecture**: Modular design for easy maintenance and testing
- **State Management**: Reactive UI updates with Riverpod
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient progress tracking without battery drain

### 3. Scalability
- **Episode Support**: Easy to add new episodes and scenes
- **Audio Management**: Flexible audio system for different content types
- **Progress Algorithms**: Configurable trigger points for different story structures
- **Service Integration**: Clean interfaces for future enhancements

## Testing
