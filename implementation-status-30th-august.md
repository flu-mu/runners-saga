- **Workaround**: Users must keep app open to experience full story

### 2. **Background Audio Management**
- **Issue**: Audio scenes don't automatically play in background
- **Impact**: Story continuity is interrupted when app is backgrounded
- **Workaround**: Manual return to foreground to continue story
