---

## Scene 1: Mission Briefing (3 minutes)
**Location:** Courier Corps Base - Abandoned Fire Station
**Audio:** Low ambient base camp sounds, distant generator hum, muffled conversations

**[SOUND: Radio static, clearing to clear channel]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Gruff, military precision] Alright, listen up, rookie. Riley, right? Used to run track before the world went to hell?

**RILEY:** [Nervous but determined] Yes sir. State championships, 800 meter. Though I guess that doesn't count for much now.

**MORRISON:** [Slight chuckle] Kid, in this world, being fast is the difference between living and becoming lunch. Maya, bring our newbie up to speed.

**[SOUND: Footsteps approaching, gear clanking]**

**MAYA:** [Confident, seasoned] Riley, welcome to the Corps. I'm Ghost - call me Maya. Been doing this for eight months now. First rule: the infected are predictable. They're slow, they're stupid, and they follow sound. It's the living you gotta watch out for.

**RILEY:** How many... how many are out there?

**MAYA:** In the suburbs? Maybe two, three hundred scattered around. Downtown's worse - thousands packed in like sardines. But today's milk run. Simple supply cache retrieval.

**[SOUND: Map unfolding on table]**

**MORRISON:** Here's your route, rookie. [Pointing] Two miles northeast to Pinewood Mall. Supply cache is in the old GameStop - medicines, canned goods, batteries. Should be a straight shot through residential streets.

**TOMMY:** [Young voice, excited] Riley! Riley! I mapped the area yesterday from the water tower. Most of the infected are on the main roads, but there's a cluster near the playground.

**MAYA:** Thanks, kid. Riley, Tommy's our eyes and ears. Smart little scout.

**TOMMY:** I counted forty-three shamblers between here and the mall. Oh, and there's something weird - some of them were moving faster than usual.

**MORRISON:** [Concerned] Faster how?

**TOMMY:** Like... jogging speed? Never seen that before.

**[SOUND: Radio crackling to life]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio, slightly distorted] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen, Atlanta Safe Zone. Do you copy?

**MORRISON:** [Into radio] Copy, Dr. Chen. Morrison here.

**DR. CHEN:** Commander, we've been tracking some unusual infected behavior. Reports of increased mobility, basic problem-solving. Your people need to be extra careful out there.

**RILEY:** [Quietly] Great. My first day and the zombies got an upgrade.

**MAYA:** [Reassuring] Stick with me, follow my lead, and you'll be fine. Ready to save some lives?

**RILEY:** [Taking deep breath] Let's do this.

**[SOUND: Gear being secured, door opening, ambient suburban decay sounds begin]**

## Scene 2: The Journey (4 minutes)
**Location:** Suburban Streets - Overgrown neighborhoods
**Audio:** Wind through broken windows, distant moaning, footsteps on broken asphalt

**[SOUND: Footsteps beginning at jogging pace, breathing steadily]**

**MAYA:** [Via earpiece, breathing slightly heavy] Stay close, maintain this pace. See that house with the blue door? Three shamblers in the yard, but they're facing away. We're invisible if we're quiet.

**RILEY:** [Breathing controlled] This feels surreal. Six months ago I was worried about midterms.

**MAYA:** What were you studying?

**RILEY:** Pre-med. Wanted to help people, you know? Guess I still am, just... differently.

**[SOUND: Distant moan, growing closer]**

**MAYA:** [Whispered] Hold up. You hear that?

**[SOUND: Shambling footsteps, dragging sounds]**

**RILEY:** [Whispered] To our right. Behind the overturned car.

**MAYA:** Good eye. It's alone, moving away from us. Let's give it space and keep moving.

**[SOUND: Footsteps resume, more cautious]**

**MAYA:** So what got you into running?

**RILEY:** My dad. He said running was the most honest sport - just you against yourself, no equipment, no teammates to blame. Never thought it would literally save my life.

**MAYA:** [Slight laugh] Mine too. Corporate security before all this. Spent more time in boardrooms than outdoors. Amazing how the apocalypse can improve your cardio.

**[SOUND: Sudden growling, much closer than expected]**

**RILEY:** [Startled] What was that?

**MAYA:** [Alert] That wasn't a shambler. Riley, we might have a problem.

**[SOUND: Fast-moving footsteps approaching, aggressive snarling]**

**RILEY:** [Panic creeping in] Maya, something's coming through the hedge!

**MAYA:** [Urgent] Run! NOW! Forget stealth - GO GO GO!

**[SOUND: Sprint begins, heavy breathing, fast footsteps on pavement]**

---

## Scene 3: First Contact (4 minutes)
**Location:** Pinewood Mall Parking Lot
**Audio:** Sprint-pace breathing, snarling getting closer, shopping carts rattling

**[SOUND: Sprint continues, breathing heavy, multiple growling sounds behind them]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard] What are those things?! They're keeping up!

**MAYA:** [Winded but focused] Runner zombies! Tommy was right - they're evolving! Don't look back, just run!

**[SOUND: Aggressive snarling very close, sound of something leaping]**

**RILEY:** [Terrified] IT JUMPED! IT ACTUALLY JUMPED AT ME!

**MAYA:** [Shouting] Shopping carts! Use the shopping carts!

**[SOUND: Metal clanging, shopping carts being pushed and toppling]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing heavily] That... that slowed them down!

**MAYA:** [Catching breath] Runner zombies are fast but clumsy. Obstacles confuse them. The mall's just ahead - we need to get inside.

**[SOUND: More snarling, multiple sets of fast footsteps approaching]**

**RILEY:** There's more of them! A whole pack!

**MAYA:** [Determined] The entrance - those glass doors. We get inside, they'll have to funnel through. Gives us an advantage.

**[SOUND: Glass doors being pushed open, echo of mall interior]**

**RILEY:** [Amazed despite danger] Look at this place. It's like a tomb.

**[SOUND: Footsteps echo in empty mall, distant shambler moans from deeper inside]**

**MAYA:** [Cautious] Mall's not empty. Hear that? Standard shamblers deeper in, but they're slow. The runners are our immediate problem.

**[SOUND: Glass doors rattling, aggressive pounding]**

**RILEY:** [Looking back] They're at the entrance, but they can't figure out how to open the doors!

**MAYA:** [Relieved] See? Fast but stupid. We've got maybe two minutes before they find another way in or break through. GameStop's on the second level - let's move.

**[SOUND: Footsteps on mall tiles, escalator creaking as they climb]**

**TOMMY:** [Via radio, excited] Riley! Maya! I can see you through the skylight! There are runners circling the building, but the main group's still trying to get through the front!

**MAYA:** [Into radio] Thanks for the eyes, Tommy. How many?

**TOMMY:** I count... eight runners outside, maybe a dozen shamblers inside the mall, but they're all on the ground floor.

**RILEY:** [Breathing easier] We're almost there. I can see the GameStop sign.

**[SOUND: Sudden crash from below, glass breaking]**

**MAYA:** [Urgent] They're in! Move faster!

---

## Scene 4: The Crisis (5 minutes)
**Location:** GameStop & Mall Upper Level
**Audio:** Chaos from below, multiple zombie types, structural damage

**[SOUND: Snarling echoing through mall, footsteps pounding up escalators]**

**RILEY:** [At GameStop entrance] The security gate's down! How do we get in?

**MAYA:** [Urgent] Check for a service entrance - there! Behind the counter!

**[SOUND: Metal grate being lifted, supplies being grabbed]**

**RILEY:** [Focused] Medical kit, batteries, canned food... Maya, there's enough here for weeks!

**MAYA:** [Distant shouting from mall] Take what you can carry! We've got company!

**[SOUND: Multiple types of zombie sounds - slow moaning and fast snarling mixing]**

**RILEY:** [Confused] I thought you said the runners were stupid?

**MAYA:** [Grim realization] The regular shamblers are following them up! The noise is attracting everything in the building!

**[SOUND: Footsteps approaching their location, metal rattling]**

**TOMMY:** [Via radio, panicked] Guys! The whole mall's lighting up! Every infected inside is moving toward your location!

**RILEY:** [Packing supplies] How many exits are there?

**MAYA:** [Thinking fast] Service corridors behind the food court, but we'd have to cross the main floor. Or... the skylight Tommy mentioned.

**RILEY:** [Looking up] That's got to be twenty feet up!

**[SOUND: Door being pounded, wood splintering]**

**MAYA:** [Determined] Grab that mannequin, we'll stack displays to reach the ceiling panels. Sometimes crazy is the only way out.

**[SOUND: Displays being moved, climbing sounds]**

**RILEY:** [Climbing] This is insane! I can't believe I'm doing this!

**MAYA:** [Below, defensive] Just keep climbing! I'll hold them off!

**[SOUND: Door breaking, immediate danger sounds]**

**MAYA:** [Shouting] RILEY! GO! GET OUT OF HERE!

**RILEY:** [From above] I'm not leaving you!

**MAYA:** [Fighting sounds below] The supplies are what matter! People are counting on us!

**[SOUND: Ceiling tile breaking, Riley breaking through to roof]**

**TOMMY:** [Via radio] Riley! You made it! Slide down the loading dock roof - I can see a clear path home!

**[SOUND: Sliding, then running footsteps on rooftop]**

**RILEY:** [Breathing hard, emotional] Maya! Maya, respond!

**MAYA:** [Via radio, breathless but alive] I'm okay! Found another way out! Meet you back at base!

**[SOUND: Successful escape sounds, breathing slowing down]**

---

## Scene 5: Extraction/Debrief (3 minutes)
**Location:** Return to Base
**Audio:** Base camp sounds, medical equipment, relief and concern

**[SOUND: Base camp door opening, people gathering around]**

**COMMANDER MORRISON:** [Concerned but proud] Riley! Report!

**RILEY:** [Exhausted but triumphant] Mission accomplished, sir. Medical supplies, batteries, enough food for three days. But Commander... Tommy was right about the runners.

**[SOUND: Supplies being unpacked, inventory sounds]**

**MORRISON:** [Serious] Tell me everything.

**RILEY:** They're faster than we expected, but Maya was right - they're still not smart. It's like they have speed but lost problem-solving skills.

**[SOUND: Door opening, Maya entering]**

**MAYA:** [Slightly winded] Miss me?

**RILEY:** [Relieved] Maya! How did you get out?

**MAYA:** [Casual] Service tunnel behind the pretzel stand. Led straight to the parking garage. Though I did have to explain to a very confused shambler why I was in his personal space.

**TOMMY:** [Excited] You should have seen it from up there! Riley went through the roof like some kind of action hero!

**[SOUND: Radio crackling]**

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio] Courier Base, this is Dr. Chen. Did you recover the medical supplies?

**MORRISON:** [Into radio] Affirmative, Doctor. Full success, but we've confirmed the runner zombie reports.

**DR. CHEN:** [Concerned] That's... troubling. We're seeing similar evolution patterns here in Atlanta. Commander, I need to speak with your team about establishing a more regular supply line.

**RILEY:** [Curious] Supply line?

**MORRISON:** [Looking at Riley with new respect] Dr. Chen's working on something big down there. Something that could change everything. But she needs materials, and we need someone fast enough to get them to her.

**MAYA:** [Grinning] Looks like the rookie's officially graduated.

**RILEY:** [Determined] Whatever she needs. People are depending on us.

**DR. CHEN:** [Via radio, hopeful] Riley, is it? Welcome to the fight. What we're working on here... it could save everyone. Every run you make brings us closer to ending this nightmare.

**[SOUND: Radio signing off, base camp winding down]**

**RILEY:** [Reflective] Six months ago, the biggest risk I took was choosing between pizza or Chinese food. Now I'm literally running for people's lives.

**MAYA:** [Wise] Funny how the world ending can show you who you really are.

**RILEY:** [Confident] Then I guess I'm a runner.

**MORRISON:** [Final] Damn right you are. Get some rest, rookie. Tomorrow we start planning something bigger.

**[SOUND: Footsteps walking away, ambient base sounds fading]**

**NARRATOR:** [Riley's internal voice] Day one was supposed to be simple. A milk run, Maya called it. But nothing's simple anymore. Every step forward is a step toward hope, and every mile I run brings us closer to finding our way back. The infected are evolving, but so are we. And tomorrow? Tomorrow we run again.

**[SOUND: Fade to silence]**
