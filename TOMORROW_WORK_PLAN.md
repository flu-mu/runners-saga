# TOMORROW'S WORK PLAN - Runners Saga App

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE FIRST

### 1. App Still Won't Launch from Phone Icon
**Status**: ‚ùå UNRESOLVED - Primary blocker
**Last Crash Log**: `Runner-2025-08-18-205723.ips` shows `PathProviderPlugin.register` crash
**Root Cause**: App crashes when launched from phone home screen (not via Xcode)
**Impact**: App is unusable for end users

**What We've Tried**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed Firebase blocking initialization in `main.dart`
- ‚úÖ Removed `audioplayers` plugin (caused crashes)
- ‚úÖ Reverted CocoaPods framework linkage changes
- ‚ùå `path_provider` still causing crashes

**Next Steps**:
- Build outside Xcode using Flutter CLI to isolate build vs runtime issues
- Analyze latest crash logs for exact failure point
- Test with minimal plugin set to identify culprit

### 2. Build Errors & Performance
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Issues**:
- gRPC modulemap errors recurring
- Xcode builds taking 10+ minutes (just took 337 seconds = 5.6 minutes)
- Constant indexing slowing development

**What We've Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ Added build speed optimizations (ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH, DWARF format, disabled indexing)
- ‚úÖ Fixed CocoaPods Profile.xcconfig warning
- ‚ùå gRPC modulemap still problematic

**Current Error** (August 18, 2025):
```
Error (Xcode): module map file
'/Users/hp/saga_run/runners_saga/ios/Pods/Headers/Private/grpc/gRPC-Core.modulemap' not found
```

**What We've Tried**:
- ‚úÖ Added build speed optimizations (ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH, DWARF format, disabled indexing)
- ‚úÖ Fixed CocoaPods Profile.xcconfig warning
- ‚ùå gRPC modulemap still problematic despite multiple approaches:
  - Tried excluding gRPC pods (didn't work)
  - Tried forcing Firebase versions (version conflicts)
  - Tried creating modulemap file manually (still fails)
  - Tried post_install hooks to copy/create modulemap (still fails)

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT & CLEANUP

### 3. Audio System Disabled
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è TEMPORARILY DISABLED
**Files Modified**:
- `audio_manager.dart` - All AudioPlayer code commented out
- `scene_trigger_service.dart` - AudioPlayer code commented out  
- `run_session_manager.dart` - AudioPlayer code commented out

**Impact**: Core audio functionality broken
**Plan**: Re-enable once app launch issue resolved

### 4. Plugin Dependencies
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNSTABLE
**Current State**:
- `audioplayers`: ‚ùå Removed (caused crashes)
- `path_provider`: ‚ö†Ô∏è Enabled but causing crashes
- Firebase plugins: ‚úÖ Working

## üìã CLAUDE AI RECOMMENDATIONS TO EVALUATE

**From User**: "i got cclaude ai to check the repository and it made some recommendations - which ones should we impletment that might help"

**Need to Review**:
- Which specific recommendations were made
- Prioritize by impact vs effort
- Focus on ones that might fix app launch issue

## üéØ ORIGINAL TASKS (Still Pending)

### 5. Product Features Implementation
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Original Goal**: "start on some of the list of product features"
**Files to Check**:
- `TASKS.md` - Product feature list
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Specific implementation items

## üöÄ TOMORROW'S PRIORITY ORDER

### Phase 1: Fix App Launch (CRITICAL)
1. **Build outside Xcode** using Flutter CLI
2. **Test app launch** from phone icon
3. **Analyze crash logs** if still failing
4. **Identify exact plugin causing crash**

### Phase 2: Stabilize Build System
1. **Resolve gRPC modulemap errors** - NEW STRATEGY NEEDED
   - ‚ùå **ALL PREVIOUS APPROACHES FAILED**: Excluding pods, forcing versions, manual file creation
   - **NEW PLAN FOR TOMORROW**: 
     - Option A: Try Flutter CLI build (bypass Xcode entirely)
     - Option B: Downgrade Firebase to version without gRPC dependencies
     - Option C: Temporarily disable Firebase to test if it's the only blocker
   - **DECISION POINT**: Choose strategy based on priority (app launch vs Firebase features)
2. **Verify build speed optimizations** are working
3. **Test clean builds** from Flutter CLI

### Phase 3: Restore Functionality
1. **Re-enable audio system** (if app launch fixed)
2. **Test core app features** work
3. **Verify no regressions**

### Phase 4: Product Development
1. **Review Claude AI recommendations**
2. **Start implementing** prioritized product features
3. **Follow morning chat setup process**

## üìÅ FILES TO FOCUS ON TOMORROW

### Core Issue Files:
- `lib/main.dart` - App initialization
- `ios/Podfile` - CocoaPods configuration
- `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Build settings

### Audio System Files (Phase 3):
- `lib/shared/services/audio_manager.dart`
- `lib/shared/services/scene_trigger_service.dart`
- `lib/shared/services/run_session_manager.dart`

### Product Feature Files:
- `TASKS.md` - Feature requirements
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Implementation details

## üîç DEBUGGING APPROACH FOR TOMORROW

### 1. Use Flutter CLI Instead of Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/hp/saga_run/runners_saga
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Start timer for build
echo "üöÄ Starting Flutter build at $(date)"
start_time=$(date +%s)

flutter run -d 00008130-001C50D40821401C

# End timer and show duration
end_time=$(date +%s)
duration=$((end_time - start_time))
echo "‚úÖ Build completed in ${duration} seconds ($(($duration/60)) minutes $(($duration%60)) seconds)"
```

**Alternative - Build first, then install:**
```bash
flutter build ios --debug
```

### 2. Test App Launch Process
- Build and install via Flutter CLI
- Close app completely (swipe up and close)
- Launch from phone home screen
- Tell me what happens (crashes, opens, etc.)
- If crashes, get crash log from Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data

### 3. Plugin Isolation Testing
- Test with minimal plugin set
- Add plugins back one by one
- Identify exact failure point

### 4. What to Monitor During Build
- **Build time** vs Xcode (should be faster)
- **Installation success**
- **App launch behavior** from phone icon
- **Any new error messages**

## üìù NOTES FOR TOMORROW

- **User Preference**: "no fallback extra methods - just focus on the task to implement"
- **User Preference**: "stop why not figure out the problem with the pathprovider rather than changing and commenting out code"
- **User Preference**: "build outside xcode for now so that we can reduce the time wasting"
- **Security Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Leaked Firebase key removed and new key created

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR TOMORROW

1. **App launches successfully** from phone home screen
2. **Build system stable** and reasonably fast
3. **Core functionality restored** (audio system working)
4. **Product development can begin**

## ü§î DECISION MATRIX FOR TOMORROW

### **Priority 1: Get App Launching**
- **Option A**: Try Flutter CLI build (bypass Xcode gRPC issues)
  - Pros: Quick test, might work around gRPC
  - Cons: Still need to solve gRPC eventually
- **Option B**: Downgrade Firebase (remove gRPC dependency)
  - Pros: Solves gRPC issue permanently
  - Cons: Might lose newer Firebase features
- **Option C**: Temporarily disable Firebase
  - Pros: Fastest path to test app launch
  - Cons: Loses authentication/storage functionality

### **Decision Criteria**:
- **If app launch is critical**: Try Option A first, then Option C
- **If Firebase features are critical**: Try Option B
- **If we need to ship soon**: Option C to get basic app working
